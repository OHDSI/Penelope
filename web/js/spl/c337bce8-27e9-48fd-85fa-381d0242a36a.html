<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">Mometasone Furoate Cream 0.1% contains mometasone furoate, USP 
for dermatologic use. Mometasone furoate is a synthetic corticosteroid with 
anti-inflammatory activity.</p>
<p>Chemically, mometasone furoate is 
9α,21-Dichloro-11β,17-dihydroxy-16α-methylpregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dione 
17-(2-furoate), with the empirical formula C<span class="Sub">27</span>H<span class="Sub">30</span>CI<span class="Sub">2</span>O<span class="Sub">6</span>, a 
molecular weight of 521.4 and the following structural formula:</p>
<br><p><img alt="Structure Image" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=c337bce8-27e9-48fd-85fa-381d0242a36a&amp;name=mometasonechemstructure.jpg"></p>
<p>Mometasone furoate is a white to off-white powder practically insoluble in 
water, slightly soluble in octanol, and moderately soluble in ethyl alcohol.</p>
<p>Each gram of Mometasone Furoate Cream 0.1% contains: 1 mg mometasone furoate, 
USP in a cream base of hexylene glycol, phosphoric acid, propylene glycol 
stearate, stearyl alcohol and ceteareth-20, titanium dioxide, aluminum starch 
octenylsuccinate, white wax, white petrolatum, and purified water.</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">Like other topical corticosteroids, mometasone furoate has 
anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive properties. The mechanism 
of the anti-inflammatory activity of the topical steroids, in general, is 
unclear. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of 
phospholipase A<span class="Sub">2</span> inhibitory proteins, collectively called 
lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of 
potent mediators of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4053015" conceptname="Inflammation">inflammation</span> such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by 
inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic acid. Arachidonic 
acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A<span class="Sub">2</span>.</p>
<a href="#section-"></a><a href="#section-"></a><a href="#section-"></a><span class="Bold"><br>Pharmacokinetics</span>:<p>The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids 
is determined by many factors including the vehicle and the integrity of the 
epidermal barrier. Occlusive dressings with hydrocortisone for up to 24 hours 
have not been demonstrated to increase penetration; however, occlusion of 
hydrocortisone for 96 hours markedly  enhances penetration.</p>
<p>Studies in humans indicate that approximately 0.4% of the applied dose of 
Mometasone Furoate Cream 0.1% enters the circulation after 8 hours of contact on 
normal skin without occlusion. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4053015" conceptname="Inflammation">Inflammation</span> and/or other disease processes in 
the skin may increase percutaneous absorption.</p>
<p>Studies performed with Mometasone Furoate Cream 0.1% indicate that it is in 
the medium range of potency as compared with other topical corticosteroids.</p>
<p>In a study evaluating the effects of mometasone furoate cream on the 
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, 15 grams were applied twice daily for 
7 days to six adult patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140168" conceptname="Psoriasis">psoriasis</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="133834" conceptname="Atopic dermatitis">atopic dermatitis</span>. The cream was 
applied without occlusion to at least 30% of the body surface. The results show 
that the drug caused a slight lowering of adrenal corticosteroid secretion.</p>
<p>In a pediatric trial, 24 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="133834" conceptname="Atopic dermatitis">atopic dermatitis</span> patients, of which 19 patients 
were age 2 to 12 years, were treated with Mometasone Furoate Cream 0.1% once 
daily. The majority of patients cleared within 3 weeks.</p>
<p>Ninety-seven pediatric patients ages 6 to 23 months, with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="133834" conceptname="Atopic dermatitis">atopic dermatitis</span>, 
were enrolled in an open-label, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis safety 
study. Mometasone Furoate Cream 0.1% was applied once daily for approximately 3 
weeks over a mean body surface area of 41% (range 15% to 94%). In approximately 
16% of patients who showed normal adrenal function by Cortrosyn test before 
starting treatment, adrenal suppression was observed at the end of treatment 
with Mometasone Furoate Cream 0.1%. The criteria for suppression were: basal 
cortisol level of ≤ 5 mcg/dL, 30-minute post-stimulation level of ≤ 18 mcg/dL, 
or an increase of less than 7 mcg/dL. Followup testing 2 to 4 weeks after stopping 
treatment, available for 5 of the patients, demonstrated suppressed HPA axis 
function in one patient, using these same criteria.</p>

<h1>INDICATIONS AND USAGE</h1>
<p class="First">Mometasone Furoate Cream 0.1% is a medium potency corticosteroid 
indicated for the relief of the inflammatory and pruritic manifestations of 
corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses.</p>
<p>Mometasone Furoate Cream 0.1% may be used in pediatric patients 2 years of 
age or older, although the safety and efficacy of drug use for longer than 3 
weeks have not been established (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#ID_15158eb1-cea6-d2dc-dc29-87cd23b33180">PRECAUTIONS – Pediatric 
Use</a> </span>section). Since safety and efficacy of Mometasone Furoate Cream 
0.1% have not been established in pediatric patients below 2 years of age, its 
use in this age group is not recommended.</p>

<h1>PRECAUTIONS</h1>
<a href="#section-"></a><span class="Bold"><br>General:</span><p class="First">Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids can produce 
reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the 
potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency after withdrawal of treatment. 
Manifestations of Cushing’s syndrome, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214376" conceptname="Hyperglycemia">hyperglycemia</span>, and glucosuria can also be 
produced in some patients by systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids 
while on treatment.</p>
<p>Patients applying a topical steroid to a large surface area or to areas under 
occlusion should be evaluated periodically for evidence of HPA axis suppression. 
This may be done by using the ACTH stimulation, A.M. plasma cortisol, and 
urinary free cortisol tests.</p>
<p>In a study evaluating the effects of mometasone furoate cream on the 
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, 15 grams were applied twice daily for 
7 days to six adult patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140168" conceptname="Psoriasis">psoriasis</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="133834" conceptname="Atopic dermatitis">atopic dermatitis</span>. The cream was 
applied without occlusion to at least 30% of the body surface. The results show 
that the drug caused a slight lowering of adrenal corticosteroid secretion.</p>
<p>If HPA axis suppression is noted, an attempt should be made to withdraw the 
drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent 
corticosteroid. Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt upon 
discontinuation of topical corticosteroids. Infrequently, signs and symptoms of 
glucocorticosteroid insufficiency may occur requiring supplemental systemic 
corticosteroids. For information on systemic supplementation, see Prescribing 
Information for those products.</p>
<p>Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from 
equivalent doses due to their larger skin surface to body <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4041088" conceptname="Mass">mass</span> ratios (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#section-">  PRECAUTIONS – 
Pediatric Use</a></span>).</p>
<p>If irritation develops, Mometasone Furoate Cream 0.1% should be discontinued 
and appropriate therapy instituted. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="134438" conceptname="Contact dermatitis">Allergic contact dermatitis</span> with 
corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by observing a failure to heal rather than 
noting a clinical exacerbation as with most topical products not containing 
corticosteroids. Such an observation should be corroborated with appropriate 
diagnostic patch testing.</p>
<p>If concomitant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201093" conceptname="Infection of skin AND/OR subcutaneous tissue">skin infections</span> are present or develop, an appropriate 
antifungal or antibacterial agent should be used. If a favorable response does 
not occur promptly, use of Mometasone Furoate Cream 0.1% should be discontinued 
until the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span> has been adequately controlled.</p>

carcinogenic potential of Mometasone Furoate Cream 0.1%. Long-term 
carcinogenicity studies of mometasone furoate were conducted by the inhalation 
route in rats and mice. In a 2-year carcinogenicity study in Sprague-Dawley 
rats, mometasone furoate demonstrated no statistically significant increase of 
tumors at inhalation doses up to 67 mcg/kg (approximately 0.04 times the 
estimated maximum clinical topical dose from Mometasone Furoate Cream 0.1% on a

(approximately 0.05 times the estimated maximum clinical topical dose from 
Mometasone Furoate Cream 0.1% on a mcg/m<span class="Sup">2 </span>basis).</p>
<p>Mometasone furoate increased chromosomal aberrations in an <span class="Italics">in vitro </span>Chinese hamster ovary cell assay, but did not

and 0.4 times the estimated maximum clinical topical dose from Mometasone 
Furoate Cream 0.1% on a mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>  basis.)</p>
<p>In rabbits, mometasone furoate caused multiple malformations (eg, flexed

<p>When rats received subcutaneous doses of mometasone furoate throughout 
pregnancy or during the later stages of pregnancy, 15 mcg/kg caused prolonged

<p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of teratogenic effects from 
topically applied corticosteroids in pregnant women. Therefore, topical 
corticosteroids should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit 
justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p>

<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<p class="First">Topically applied Mometasone Furoate Cream 0.1% can be absorbed 
in sufficient amounts to produce systemic effects (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#ID_16BC2E6B-CD64-5B42-EFCC-2CF2500157CB">PRECAUTIONS</a> </span>section).</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">Apply a thin film of Mometasone Furoate Cream 0.1% to the 
affected skin areas once daily. Mometasone Furoate Cream 0.1% may be used in 
pediatric patients 2 years of age or older. Since safety and efficacy of 
Mometasone Furoate Cream 0.1% have not been adequately established in pediatric 
patients below 2 years of age, its use in this age group is not recommended (see 
<span class="Bold"><a href="#ID_15158eb1-cea6-d2dc-dc29-87cd23b33180">PRECAUTIONS 
– Pediatric Use</a> </span>section).</p>
<p>As with other corticosteroids, therapy should be discontinued when control is 
achieved. If no improvement is seen within 2 weeks, reassessment of diagnosis 
may be necessary. Safety and efficacy of Mometasone Furoate Cream 0.1% in 
pediatric patients for more than 3 weeks of use have not been established. 
Mometasone Furoate Cream 0.1% should not be used with occlusive dressings unless 
directed by a physician. Mometasone Furoate Cream 0.1% should not be applied in 
the diaper area if the child still requires diapers or plastic pants as these 
garments may constitute occlusive dressing.</p>
