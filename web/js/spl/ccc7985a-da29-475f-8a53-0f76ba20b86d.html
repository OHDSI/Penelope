<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">DERMATOP<span class="Sup">®</span> Emollient Cream (prednicarbate emollient cream) 0.1% contains prednicarbate, a synthetic corticosteroid for topical dermatologic use. The chemical name of prednicarbate is 11<span class="Italics">β,</span> 17, 21-trihydroxypregna-1,4-diene- 3,20-dione 17-(ethyl carbonate) 21-propionate.  Prednicarbate has the empirical formula C<span class="Sub">27</span>H<span class="Sub">36</span>O<span class="Sub">8</span> and a molecular weight of 488.58.  Topical corticosteroids constitute a class of primarily synthetic steroids used topically as anti-inflammatory and antipruritic agents.</p>
<p>The CAS Registry Number is 73771-04-7. The chemical structure is:</p>
<div class="Figure"><img alt="Chemical Structure" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=ccc7985a-da29-475f-8a53-0f76ba20b86d&amp;name=dermatop-cream-01.jpg"></div>
<p>Prednicarbate is a practically odorless white to yellow-white powder insoluble to practically insoluble in water and freely soluble in ethanol.</p>
<p>Each gram of DERMATOP Emollient Cream 0.1% contains 1.0 mg of prednicarbate in a base consisting of white petrolatum USP, purified water USP, isopropyl myristate NF, lanolin alcohols NF, mineral oil USP, cetostearyl alcohol NF, aluminum stearate, edetate disodium USP, lactic acid USP, and magnesium stearate DAB 9.</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">In common with other topical corticosteroids, prednicarbate has anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive properties. In general, the mechanism of the anti-inflammatory activity of topical steroids is unclear. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A<span class="Sub">2</span> inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4053015" conceptname="Inflammation">inflammation</span> such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A<span class="Sub">2</span>.</p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
<p class="First">The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors, including the vehicle and the integrity of the epidermal barrier. Use of occlusive dressings with hydrocortisone for up to 24 hours have not been shown to increase penetration; however, occlusion of hydrocortisone for 96 hours does markedly enhance penetration. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4053015" conceptname="Inflammation">Inflammation</span> and/or other disease processes in the skin increase percutaneous absorption.</p>
<p>Studies performed with DERMATOP Emollient Cream (prednicarbate emollient cream) 0.1 % indicate that the drug product is in the medium range of potency compared with other topical corticosteroids.</p>

<h1>INDICATIONS AND USAGE</h1>
<p class="First">DERMATOP Emollient Cream 0.1%  is a medium-potency corticosteroid indicated for the relief of the inflammatory and pruritic manifestations of corticosteroid responsive dermatoses. DERMATOP Emollient Cream 0.1%  may be used with caution in pediatric patients 1 year of age or older. The safety and efficacy of drug use for longer than 3 weeks in this population have not been established. Since safety and efficacy of DERMATOP Emollient Cream 0.1% have not been established in pediatric patients below 1 year of age, its use in this age group is not recommended.</p>

<h1>CONTRAINDICATIONS</h1>
<p class="First">DERMATOP  Emollient Cream 0.1% is contraindicated in those patients with a history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity</span> to any of the components in the preparations.</p>

<h1>PRECAUTIONS</h1>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34072-9">
<a name="section-6.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>General</h2>
<p class="First">Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids can produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency after withdrawal of treatment.  Manifestations of Cushing's syndrome, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214376" conceptname="Hyperglycemia">hyperglycemia</span>, and glucosuria can also be produced in some patients by systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids while on treatment.</p>
<p>Patients applying a topical steroid to a large surface area or under occlusion should be evaluated periodically for evidence of HPA-axis suppression.  This may be done by using the ACTH stimulation, A.M. plasma cortisol, and urinary free cortisol tests. DERMATOP Emollient Cream 0.1% did not produce significant HPA-axis suppression when used at a dose of 30g/day for a week in 10 adult patients with extensive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140168" conceptname="Psoriasis">psoriasis</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="133834" conceptname="Atopic dermatitis">atopic dermatitis</span>. DERMATOP Emollient Cream 0.1% did not produce HPA-axis suppression in any of 59 pediatric patients with extensive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="133834" conceptname="Atopic dermatitis">atopic dermatitis</span> when applied BID for 3 weeks to &gt; 20% of the body surface <span class="Bold">(See <a href="#Pediatric_Use">PRECAUTIONS, Pediatric Use</a>.)</span></p>
<p>If HPA-axis suppression is noted, an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of the application, or to substitute a less potent corticosteroid. Recovery of HPA-axis function is generally prompt upon discontinuation of topical corticosteroids. Infrequently, signs and symptoms of glucocorticosteroid insufficiency may occur, requiring supplemental systemic corticosteroids. For information on systemic supplementation, see prescribing information for those products.</p>
<p>Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses due to their larger skin surface to body <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4041088" conceptname="Mass">mass</span> ratios. <span class="Bold">(See <a href="#Pediatric_Use">PRECAUTIONS, Pediatric Use</a>.)</span></p>
<p>If irritation develops, DERMATOP Emollient Cream 0.1% should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted.  <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="134438" conceptname="Contact dermatitis">Allergic contact dermatitis</span> with corticosteroids is usually  diagnosed by observing a failure to heal rather than noting a clinical exacerbation, as observed with most topical products not containing corticosteroids.  Such an observation should be corroborated with appropriate diagnostic patch testing.</p>
<p>If concomitant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201093" conceptname="Infection of skin AND/OR subcutaneous tissue">skin infections</span> are present or develop, an appropriate antifungal or antibacterial agent should be used.</p>
<p>If a favorable response does not occur promptly, use of DERMATOP Emollient Cream 0.1% should be discontinued until the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span> has been adequately controlled.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34076-0">

<h2>Information for Patients</h2>
<p class="First">Patients using topical corticosteroids should receive the following information and instructions:</p>
<ol>
<li>This medication is to be used as directed by the physician. It is for external use only. Avoid contact with the eyes.</li>
<li>This medication should not be used for any disorder other than that for which it was prescribed.</li>
<li>The treated skin area should not be bandaged, otherwise covered or wrapped so as to be occlusive, unless directed by the physician.</li>
<li>Patients should report to their physician any signs of local adverse reactions.</li>
<li>Parents of pediatric patients should be advised not to use this medication in the treatment of diaper <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="133835" conceptname="Eczema">dermatitis</span>. This medication should not be applied in the diaper area as diapers or plastic pants may constitute occlusive dressing <span class="Bold">(See <a href="#Dosage_and_Admin">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>)</span>.</li>
<li>This medication should not be used on the face, underarms, or groin areas.</li>
<li>Contact between DERMATOP Emollient Cream 0.1% and latex containing products (eg. condoms, diaphragm etc.) should be avoided since paraffin in contact with latex can cause damage and reduce the effectiveness of any latex containing products. If latex products come into contact with DERMATOP Emollient Cream 0.1%, patients should be advised to discard the latex products.  Patients should be advised that this medication is to be used externally only, not intravaginally.</li>
</ol>
<p>As with other corticosteroids, therapy should be discontinued when control is achieved.  If no improvement is seen within two weeks, contact the physician.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34075-2">
<a name="section-6.3"></a><p></p>
<h2>Laboratory Tests</h2>
<p class="First">The following tests may be helpful in evaluating patients for HPA-axis suppression:</p>
<p>        ACTH stimulation test<br>        A.M. plasma cortisol test<br>        Urinary free cortisol test</p>

<h2>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility</h2>
<p class="First">In a study of the effect of prednicarbate on fertility, pregnancy, and postnatal development in rats, no effect was noted on the fertility or pregnancy of the parent animals or postnatal development of the offspring after administration of up to 0.80 mg/kg of prednicarbate subcutaneously.</p>
<p>Prednicarbate has been evaluated in the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4235289" conceptname="Salmonellosis">Salmonella</span> reversion test (Ames test) over a wide range of concentrations in the presence and absence of an S-9 liver microsomal fraction, and did not demonstrate mutagenic activity. Similarly, prednicarbate did not produce any significant changes in the numbers of micronuclei seen in erythrocytes when mice were given doses ranging from 1 to 160 mg/kg of the drug.</p>

<h2>Pregnancy</h2>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34077-8">
<a name="section-6.5.1"></a><p></p>
<h3>Teratogenic Effects</h3>
<p class="First"><span class="Italics">Pregnancy Category C</span></p>
<p>Corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic in laboratory animals when administered systemically at relatively low dosage levels. Some corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic after dermal application in laboratory animals.</p>
<p>Prednicarbate has been shown to be teratogenic and embryotoxic in Wistar rats and Himalayan rabbits when given subcutaneously during gestation at doses 1900 times and 45 times the recommended topical human dose, assuming a percutaneous absorption of approximately 3%. In the rats, slightly retarded fetal development and an incidence of thickened and wavy ribs higher than the spontaneous rate were noted.</p>
<p>In rabbits, increased liver weights and slight increase in the fetal intrauterine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> rate were observed. The fetuses that were delivered exhibited reduced placental weight, increased frequency of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135923" conceptname="Cleft palate">cleft palate</span>, ossification disorders in the sternum, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4077297" conceptname="Congenital omphalocele">omphalocele</span>, and anomalous posture of the forelimbs.</p>
<p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women on teratogenic effects of prednicarbate. DERMATOP Emollient Cream (prednicarbate emollient cream) 0.1% should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p>

<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34080-2">
<a name="section-6.6"></a><p></p>
<h2>Nursing Mothers</h2>
<p class="First">Systemically administered corticosteroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production, or cause other untoward effects.  It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when DERMATOP Emollient Cream 0.1% is administered to a nursing woman.</p>

<h2>Pediatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">DERMATOP Emollient Cream 0.1% may be used with caution in pediatric patients 1 year of age or older, although the safety and efficacy of drug use longer than 3 weeks have not been established. The use of DERMATOP Emollient Cream (prednicarbate emollient cream) 0.1% is supported by results of a three-week, uncontrolled study in 59 pediatric patients between the ages of 4 months and 12 years of age with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="133834" conceptname="Atopic dermatitis">atopic dermatitis</span>. None of the 59 pediatric patients showed evidence of HPA-axis suppression. Safety and efficacy of DERMATOP Emollient Cream 0.1% in pediatric patients below 1 year of age have not been established, therefore use in this age group is not recommended. Because of a higher ratio of skin surface area to body <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4041088" conceptname="Mass">mass</span>, pediatric patients are at a greater risk than adults of HPA-axis suppression and Cushing's syndrome when they are treated with topical corticosteroids. They are therefore also at greater risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="193984" conceptname="Adrenal hypofunction">adrenal insufficiency</span> during and/or after withdrawal of treatment. In an uncontrolled study in pediatric patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="133834" conceptname="Atopic dermatitis">atopic dermatitis</span>, the incidence of adverse reactions possibly or probably associated with the use of DERMATOP Emollient Cream 0.1% was limited. </p>
<p>Mild signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4028206" conceptname="Atrophy">atrophy</span> developed in 5 patients (5/59, 8%) during the clinical trial, with 2 patients exhibiting more than one sign. Two patients (2/59, 3%) developed shininess, and two patients (2/59, 3%) developed thinness. Three patients (3/59, 5%) were observed with mild <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010094" conceptname="Telangiectasis">telangiectasia</span>. It is unknown whether prior use of topical corticosterioids was a contributing factor in the development of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010094" conceptname="Telangiectasis">telangiectasia</span> in 2 of the patients. Adverse effects including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137054" conceptname="Skin striae">striae</span> have also been reported with inappropriate use of topical corticosteroids in infants and children. Pediatric patients applying topical corticosteroids to greater than 20% of body surface are at higher risk for HPA-axis suppression.</p>
