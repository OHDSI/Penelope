<h1>DESCRIPTION
</h1>
<p class="First">Capastat Sulfate is a polypeptide antibiotic isolated from <span class="Italics">Streptomyces capreolus</span>. It is a complex of 4Â microbiologically active components which have been characterized in part; however, complete structural determination of all the components has not been established.
</p>
<p>Capreomycin is supplied as the disulfate salt and is soluble in water. In complete solution, it is almost colorless.
</p>
<p>Each vial contains the equivalent of 1Â g capreomycin activity.
</p>
<p>The structural formula is as follows:

<h2>Human Pharmacology
</h2>
<p class="First">Capreomycin is not absorbed in significant quantities from the gastrointestinal tract and must be administered parenterally. In 2Â studies of 10Â patients each, peak serum concentrations following 1Â g of capreomycin given intramuscularly were achieved 1Â to 2Â hours after administration, and average peak levels reached were 28Â and 32Â Î¼g/mL respectively (range, 20Â to 47Â Î¼g/mL). Low serum concentrations were present at 24Â hours. However, 1Â g of capreomycin daily for 30Â days or more produced no significant accumulation in subjects with normal renal function. Two patients with marked reduction of renal function had high serum concentrations 24Â hours after administration of the drug. When a 1-g dose of capreomycin was given intramuscularly to normal volunteers, 52%Â was excreted in the urine within 12Â hours.
</p>
<p>Lehmann, et al, examined the pharmacokinetics of single dose capreomycin (1.0Â g) administered intramuscularly and by intravenous infusion (1Â hour) in 6Â healthy volunteers. The area under the serum concentration versus time curve was similar for the two routes of administration. Capreomycin peak concentrations after intravenous infusion were 30Â Â±Â 47% higher than after intramuscular administration.<span class="Sup">1, 2</span></p>
<p>Paper chromatographic studies indicated that capreomycin is excreted essentially unaltered. Urine concentrations averaged 1.68Â mg/mL (average urine volume, 228Â mL) during the 6Â hours following a 1-gÂ dose.

In general, the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4190299" conceptname="Broth microdilution susceptibility test">minimum inhibitory concentrations</span> for <span class="Italics">M.Â <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434557" conceptname="Tuberculosis">tuberculosis</span></span> are lowest in liquid media that are free of egg protein (7H10Â or Dubos) and range from 1Â to 5Â Î¼g/mL when the indirect method is used. Comparable inhibitory concentrations are obtained when 7H10Â agar is used for direct susceptibility testing. When indirect susceptibility tests are performed on standard tube slants with 7H10Â media, susceptible <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strains</span> are inhibited by 10Â to 25Â Î¼g/mL capreomycin. Egg-containing media, such as LÃ¶wenstein-Jensen orÂ ATS, require concentrations of 25Â to 50Â Î¼g/mL to inhibit susceptible <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strains</span>.

<h2>Cross-Resistance
</h2>
<p class="First">Frequent cross-resistance occurs between capreomycin and viomycin. Varying degrees of cross-resistance between capreomycin and kanamycin and neomycin have been reported.

<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34072-9">
<a name="s15"></a><a name="section-6.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>General
</h2>
<p class="First">Audiometric measurements and assessment of vestibular function should be performed prior to initiation of therapy with Capastat Sulfate and at regular intervals during treatment.
</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4220631" conceptname="Injury of kidney">Renal injury</span>, with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="444044" conceptname="Acute tubular necrosis">tubular necrosis</span>, elevation of the blood urea nitrogenÂ (BUN) or serum creatinine, and abnormal urinary sediment, has been noted. Slight elevation of the BUN and serum creatinine has been observed in a significant number of patients receiving prolonged therapy. The appearance of casts, red cells, and white cells in the urine has been noted in a high percentage of these cases. Elevation of the BUN above 30Â mg/100Â mL or any other evidence of decreasing renal function with or without a rise in BUN levels calls for careful evaluation of the patient, and the dosage should be reduced or the drug completely withdrawn. The clinical significance of abnormal urine sediment and slight elevation in the BUN (or serum creatinine) observed during long-term therapy with Capastat Sulfate has not been established.
</p>
<p>The peripheral neuromuscular blocking action that has been attributed to other polypeptide antibiotics (colistin sulfate, polymyxinÂ A sulfate, paromomycin, and viomycin) and to aminoglycoside antibiotics (streptomycin, dihydrostreptomycin, neomycin, and kanamycin) has been studied with Capastat Sulfate. A partial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4205421" conceptname="Neuromuscular block">neuromuscular blockade</span> was demonstrated after large intravenous doses of Capastat Sulfate. This action was enhanced by ether anesthesia (as has been reported for neomycin) and was antagonized by neostigmine.
</p>
<p>Caution should be exercised in the administration of antibiotics, including Capastat Sulfate, to any patient who has demonstrated some form of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">allergy</span>, particularly to drugs.

<p class="First">Capastat Sulfate has been shown to be teratogenic in rats when given in doses 3Â 1/2Â times the human dose. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Capastat Sulfate should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus (<span class="Italics">see boxed</span><a href="#s3"> WARNINGS</a><span class="Italics"> and </span><a href="#s36">ANIMAL PHARMACOLOGY</a>).

<h2>Geriatric Use
</h2>
<p class="First">Clinical studies of Capastat Sulfate did not analyze the safety and efficacy of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.
</p>
<p>Capastat Sulfate is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney <span class="Italics">(see</span><a href="#s7"> CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a>), and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span>. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function (<span class="Italics">see</span><a href="#s16"> PRECAUTIONS, Laboratory Tests</a>). Patients with reduced renal function should have dosage reduction based on creatinine clearance using the guidelines included in <a href="#t1">Table 1</a> (<span class="Italics">see</span><a href="#s32"> DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>).
</p>
<p>The geriatric population is also more likely to have impaired hearing at baseline. Audiometric measurements and assessment of vestibular function should be performed prior to initiation of therapy with Capastat Sulfate and at regular intervals during treatment (<span class="Italics">see</span><a href="#s15"> PRECAUTIONS, General</a>).

<h2>Treatment
</h2>
<p class="First">To obtain up-to-date information about the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>, a good resource is your certified Regional Poison Control Center. Telephone numbers of certified poison control centers are listed in the <span class="Italics">Physicians' Desk Reference (PDR).</span> In managing overdosage, consider the possibility of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">multiple drug overdoses</span>, interaction among drugs, and unusual drug kinetics in your patient.
</p>
<p>Protect the patient's airway and support ventilation and perfusion. Meticulously monitor and maintain, within acceptable limits, the patient's vital signs, blood gases, serum electrolytes, etc. Absorption of drugs from the gastrointestinal tract may be decreased by giving activated charcoal, which, in many cases, is more effective than <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">emesis</span> or lavage; consider charcoal instead of or in addition to gastric emptying. Repeated doses of charcoal over time may hasten elimination of some drugs that have been absorbed. Safeguard the patient's airway when employing gastric emptying or charcoal.
</p>
<p>Patients who have received an <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> of capreomycin and have normal renal function should be carefully hydrated to maintain a urine output of 3Â to 5Â mL/kg/h. Fluid balance, electrolytes, and creatinine clearance should be carefully monitored.

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
</h1>
<p class="First">Capastat Sulfate may be administered intramuscularly or intravenously following reconstitution. Reconstitution is achieved by dissolving the vial contents (1Â g) in 2Â mL of 0.9%Â Sodium Chloride Injection or Sterile Water for Injection. Two to 3Â minutes should be allowed for complete dissolution.
