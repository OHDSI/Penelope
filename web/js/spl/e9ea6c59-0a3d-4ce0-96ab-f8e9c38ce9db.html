<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">Malathion lotion contains 0.005 g of malathion per mL in a vehicle of isopropyl alcohol (78%), terpineol, dipentene, and pine needle oil. The chemical name of malathion is (±) - [(dimethoxyphosphinothioyl) - thio] butanedioic acid diethyl ester. Malathion has a molecular weight of 330.36, represented by C<span class="Sub">10</span>H<span class="Sub">19</span>O<span class="Sub">6</span>PS<span class="Sub">2</span>, and has the following chemical structure:</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">Malathion is an organophosphate agent which acts as a pediculicide by inhibiting <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4052720" conceptname="Acetylcholinesterase">cholinesterase</span> activity <span class="Italics">in vivo.</span> Inadvertent transdermal absorption of malathion has occurred from its agricultural use. In such cases, acute toxicity was manifested by excessive cholinergic activity, i.e., increased <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138565" conceptname="Hyperhidrosis">sweating</span>, salivary and gastric secretion, gastrointestinal and uterine motility, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169095" conceptname="Bradycardia">bradycardia</span> (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#overdosage">OVERDOSAGE</a></span>). Because the potential for transdermal absorption of malathion from malathion lotion is not known at this time, strict adherence to the dosing instructions regarding its use in children, method of application, duration of exposure, and frequency of application is required.</p>

<h2>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility</h2>
<p class="First">Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis and impairment of fertility have not been studied with malathion lotion (0.5% pharmaceutical grade malathion). However, following long-term oral administration of technical grade malathion to rodents via dietary supplementation, increased incidences of hepatocellular neoplastic lesions were observed in B6C3F1 mice dosed for 18 months at malathion doses greater than 1500 mg/kg/day, and in female F344 rats dosed for 2 years at malathion doses greater than 400 mg/kg/day. These tumors occurred only in association with severe hepatic toxicity and chronic suppression of acetylcholinesterase activity, or at doses causing excessive mortality. Based on body surface area, doses at which carcinogenic effects were observed in rodents following life-time exposures to malathion were approximately 14- to 26-fold greater than the maximum dose anticipated in a 10 kg child following a single use of malathion lotion, assuming 100% bioavailability. Actual systemic exposures are expected to be less than 10% of the administered dose.</p>
<p>The malathion of greater than pharmaceutical-grade purity used in malathion lotion has not been tested for genotoxicity. The technical-grade malathion (95% pure) was found to be negative in <span class="Italics"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4235289" conceptname="Salmonellosis">Salmonella</span> typhimurium</span>, equivocally positive in the mouse <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432571" conceptname="Malignant lymphoma">lymphoma</span> cell assay, 577 and positive in <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> chromosomal aberration and sister chromatid exchange assays. Fifteen separate <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> gene mutation studies with malathion of unknown purity have reported negative results, while three studies reported malathion to be mutagenic in bacterial cells. Both technical grade (94–96.5%) and purified (98-99%) malathion have been reported to cause chromosomal aberrations and sister chromatid exchanges <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> in human and hamster cell lines. <span class="Italics">In vivo</span> chromosomal aberration and micronucleus studies of technical-grade malathion are reported to be positive, whereas an <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> chromosomal aberration study of &gt;99% pure malathion was reported to be negative. Furthermore, mice exposed to malathion in their drinking water for 7 weeks demonstrated no evidence of chromosome damage in bone marrow cells, spermatogonia, or primary spermatocytes. Lack of details makes independent evaluation of the results of these assays impossible. Ashby and Purchase have suggested that impurities may be responsible for some of the observed genetic activity of malathion.</p>
<p>Reproduction studies performed with malathion in rats at doses over 180 fold greater than those anticipated in a 60 kg adult (based on body surface area and assuming 100% bioavailability) revealed no evidence of impaired fertility.</p>

<h2>Pregnancy</h2>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34077-8">
<a name="section-6.5.1"></a><p></p>
<h3>Pregnancy Category B</h3>
<p class="First">There was no evidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4240324" conceptname="Teratogenesis">teratogenicity</span> in studies in rats and rabbits at doses up to 900 mg/kg/day and 100 mg/kg/day malathion, respectively. A study in rats failed to show any gross fetal abnormalities attributable to feeding malathion up to 2,500 ppm (~ 200 mg/kg/day) in the diet during a three - generation evaluation period. These doses were approximately 40 to 180 times higher than the dose anticipated in a 60 kg adult (based on body surface area and assuming 100% bioavailability). Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human responses, this drug should be used (or handled) during pregnancy only if clearly needed.</p>

<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34080-2">
<a name="section-6.6"></a><p></p>
<h2>Nursing Mothers</h2>
<p class="First">Malathion in an acetone vehicle has been reported to be absorbed through human skin to the extent of 8% of the applied dose. However, percutaneous absorption from the malathion lotion, 0.5% formulation has not been studied, and it is not known whether malathion is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when malathion lotion is administered to (or handled by) a nursing mother.</p>

<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<p class="First">Consideration should be given, as part of the treatment program, to the high concentration of isopropyl alcohol in the vehicle.</p>
<p>Malathion, although a weaker <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4052720" conceptname="Acetylcholinesterase">cholinesterase</span> inhibitor than some other organophosphates, may be expected to exhibit the same symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4052720" conceptname="Acetylcholinesterase">cholinesterase</span> depletion after accidental ingestion orally. If accidentally swallowed, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span> should be induced promptly or the stomach lavaged with 5% sodium <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4285456" conceptname="Bicarbonate">bicarbonate</span> solution.</p>
<p>Severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4158346" conceptname="Respiratory distress">respiratory distress</span> is the major and most serious symptom of organophosphate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">poisoning</span> requiring artificial respiration, and atropine may be needed to counteract the symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4052720" conceptname="Acetylcholinesterase">cholinesterase</span> depletion.</p>
<p>Repeat analyses of serum and RBC <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4052720" conceptname="Acetylcholinesterase">cholinesterase</span> may assist in establishing the diagnosis and formulating a long - range prognosis.</p>

<h1>Clinical Studies</h1>
<p class="First">Two controlled clinical trials evaluated the pediculicidal activity of malathion lotion. Patients applied the lotion to the hair and scalp in quantities, up to a maximum of 2 fl. oz., sufficient to thoroughly wet the hair and scalp. The lotion was allowed to air dry and was shampooed with Prell shampoo 8 to 12 hours after application. Patients in both the malathion lotion group and in the vehicle group were examined immediately after shampooing, 24 hours after, and 7 days after for the presence of live lice. Results are shown in the following table:</p>
