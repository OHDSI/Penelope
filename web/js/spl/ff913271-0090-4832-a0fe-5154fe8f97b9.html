<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">ALKERAN (melphalan), also known as L-phenylalanine mustard, phenylalanine mustard, L-PAM, or L-sarcolysin, is a phenylalanine derivative of nitrogen mustard. Melphalan is a bifunctional alkylating agent which is active against selective human neoplastic diseases. It is known chemically as 4-[bis(2-chloroethyl)amino]-<span class="Italics">L-</span>phenylalanine. The molecular formula is C<span class="Sub">13</span>H<span class="Sub">18</span>Cl<span class="Sub">2</span>N<span class="Sub">2</span>O<span class="Sub">2</span> and the molecular weight is 305.20. The structural formula is:</p>

</div>
<p>Melphalan is the active L-isomer of the compound and was first synthesized in 1953 by Bergel and Stock; the D-isomer, known as medphalan, is less active against certain animal tumors, and the dose needed to produce effects on chromosomes is larger than that required with the L-isomer. The racemic (DLâˆ’) form is known as merphalan or sarcolysin.</p>
<p>Melphalan is practically insoluble in water and has a pKa<span class="Sub">1</span> of ~2.5.</p>
<p>ALKERAN (melphalan) is available in tablet form for oral administration. Each film-coated tablet contains 2Â mg melphalan and the inactive ingredients colloidal silicon dioxide, crospovidone, hypromellose, macrogol/PEGÂ 400, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, and titanium dioxide.</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">Melphalan is an alkylating agent of the bischloroethylamine type. As a result, its cytotoxicity appears to be related to the extent of its interstrand cross-linking with DNA, probably by binding at the N<span class="Sup">7</span> position of guanine. Like other bifunctional alkylating agents, it is active against both resting and rapidly dividing tumor cells.</p>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="i4i_section_id_4b231b2e-1ccd-4453-9991-65a0046e2e7f"></a><a name="section-2.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
<p class="First">The absorption of oral melphalan is highly variable with respect to both the time to first appearance of the drug in plasma (range: 0 to 6Â hours) and peak plasma concentration (C<span class="Sub">max</span>). The average absolute bioavailability of melphalan is also highly variable (range: 56% to 93%). These results may be due to incomplete intestinal absorption, a variable â€œfirst passâ€? hepatic metabolism, or to rapid hydrolysis. Oral administration of melphalan with a high fat meal may reduce melphalan exposure (AUC) by 36% to 54%. </p>
<p>In 18Â patients given a single oral dose of 0.6Â mg/kg of ALKERAN, the terminal elimination plasma half-life (t<span class="Sub">1/2</span>) of parent drug was 1.5Â Â±Â 0.83Â hours. The 24-hour urinary excretion of parent drug in these patients was 10%Â Â±Â 4.5%, suggesting that renal clearance is not a major route of elimination of parent drug. In a separate study in 18Â patients given single oral doses of 0.2 to 0.25Â mg/kg of ALKERAN, C<span class="Sub">max</span> and plasma concentration-time curves (AUC), when dose adjusted to a dose of 14Â mg, were (mean Â± SD) 212Â Â±Â 74Â ng/mL and 498Â Â±Â 137Â ngâ€¢hr/mL, respectively. Elimination phase t<span class="Sub">Â½</span> in these patients was approximately 1Â hour and the median t<span class="Sub">max</span> was 1Â hour.</p>
<p>One study using universally labeled <span class="Sup">14</span>C-melphalan, found substantially less radioactivity in the urine of patients given the drug by mouth (30% of administered dose in 9Â days) than in the urine of those given it intravenously (35% to 65% in 7Â days). Following either oral or IV administration, the pattern of label recovery was similar, with the majority being recovered in the first 24Â hours. Following oral administration, peak radioactivity occurred in plasma at 2Â hours and then disappeared with a half-life of approximately 160Â hours. In 1 patient where parent drug (rather than just radiolabel) was determined, the melphalan half-disappearance time was 67Â minutes.</p>
<p>The steady-state volume of distribution of melphalan is 0.5Â L/kg. Penetration into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is low. The average melphalan binding to plasma proteins is highly variable (range: 53% to 92%). Serum albumin is the major binding protein, accounting for approximately 40% to 60% of the plasma protein binding, while Î±<span class="Sub">1</span>-acid glycoprotein accounts for about 20% of the plasma protein binding. Approximately 30% of melphalan is (covalently) irreversibly bound to plasma proteins. Interactions with immunoglobulins have been found to be negligible.</p>
<p>Melphalan is eliminated from plasma primarily by chemical hydrolysis to monohydroxymelphalan and dihydroxymelphalan. Aside from these hydrolysis products, no other melphalan metabolites have been observed in humans. Although the contribution of renal elimination to melphalan clearance appears to be low, one pharmacokinetic study showed a significant positive correlation between the elimination rate constant for melphalan and renal function and a significant negative correlation between renal function and the area under the plasma melphalan concentration/time curve.</p>

<h1>WARNINGS</h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">ALKERAN should be administered in carefully adjusted dosage by or under the supervision of experienced physicians who are familiar with the drug's actions and the possible complications of its use.</span></p>
<p>As with other nitrogen mustard drugs, excessive dosage will produce marked bone marrow suppression. Bone marrow suppression is the most significant toxicity associated with ALKERAN in most patients. Therefore, the following tests should be performed at the start of therapy and prior to each subsequent course of ALKERAN: platelet count, hemoglobin, white blood cell count, and differential. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432870" conceptname="Thrombocytopenic disorder">Thrombocytopenia</span> and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435224" conceptname="Leukopenia">leukopenia</span> are indications to withhold further therapy until the blood counts have sufficiently recovered. Frequent blood counts are essential to determine optimal dosage and to avoid toxicity (see PRECAUTIONS: Laboratory Tests). Dose adjustment on the basis of blood counts at the nadir and day of treatment should be considered.</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">Hypersensitivity reactions</span>, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441202" conceptname="Anaphylaxis">anaphylaxis</span>, have occurred rarely (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). These reactions have occurred after multiple courses of treatment and have recurred in patients who experienced a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity reaction</span> to IV ALKERAN. If a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity reaction</span> occurs, oral or IV ALKERAN should not be readministered.</p>

<h2>Carcinogenesis</h2>
<p class="First">Secondary malignancies, including acute nonlymphocytic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315497" conceptname="Subacute leukemia">leukemia</span>, myeloproliferative syndrome, and carcinoma have been reported in patients with cancer treated with alkylating agents (including melphalan). Some patients also received other chemotherapeutic agents or radiation therapy. Precise quantitation of the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138708" conceptname="Acute leukemia">acute leukemia</span>, myeloproliferative syndrome, or carcinoma is not possible. Published reports of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315497" conceptname="Subacute leukemia">leukemia</span> in patients who have received melphalan (and other alkylating agents) suggest that the risk of leukemogenesis increases with chronicity of treatment and with cumulative dose. In one study, the 10-year cumulative risk of developing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138708" conceptname="Acute leukemia">acute leukemia</span> or myeloproliferative syndrome after melphalan therapy was 19.5% for cumulative doses ranging from 730Â mg to 9,652Â mg. In this same study, as well as in an additional study, the 10-year cumulative risk of developing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138708" conceptname="Acute leukemia">acute leukemia</span> or myeloproliferative syndrome after melphalan therapy was less than 2% for cumulative doses under 600Â mg. This does not mean that there is a cumulative dose below which there is no risk of the induction of secondary malignancy. The potential benefits from melphalan therapy must be weighed on an individual basis against the possible risk of the induction of a second malignancy.</p>
<p>Adequate and well-controlled carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted in animals. However, i.p. administration of melphalan in rats (5.4 to 10.8Â mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>) and in mice (2.25 to 4.5Â mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>) 3 times per week for 6Â months followed by 12Â months post-dose observation produced peritoneal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084784" conceptname="Sarcoma">sarcoma</span> and lung tumors, respectively.</p>

<h2>Mutagenesis</h2>
<p class="First">ALKERAN has been shown to cause chromatid or chromosome damage in humans. Intramuscular administration of ALKERAN at 6 and 60Â mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> produced structural aberrations of the chromatid and chromosomes in bone marrow cells of Wistar rats.</p>

<h2>Pregnancy</h2>
<p class="First">Pregnancy Category D<span class="Italics">.</span> ALKERAN may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Melphalan was embryolethal and teratogenic in rats following oral (6 to 18Â mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day for 10Â days) and intraperitoneal (18Â mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>) administration. Malformations resulting from melphalan included alterations of the brain (underdevelopment, deformation, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4062639" conceptname="Meningocele">meningocele</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432419" conceptname="Encephalocele">encephalocele</span>) and eye (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434143" conceptname="Anophthalmos">anophthalmia</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="376512" conceptname="Microphthalmos">microphthalmos</span>), reduction of the mandible and tail, as well as hepatocele (exomphaly).</p>
<p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant.</p>

<h2>General</h2>
<p class="First">In all instances where the use of ALKERAN is considered for chemotherapy, the physician must evaluate the need and usefulness of the drug against the risk of adverse events. ALKERAN should be used with extreme caution in patients whose bone marrow reserve may have been compromised by prior irradiation or chemotherapy, or whose marrow function is recovering from previous cytotoxic therapy. If the leukocyte count <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">falls</span> below 3,000Â cells/mcL, or the platelet count below 100,000Â cells/mcL, ALKERAN should be discontinued until the peripheral blood cell counts have recovered.</p>
<p>A recommendation as to whether or not dosage reduction should be made routinely in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal insufficiency</span> cannot be made because:</p>
<p>a)Â Â Â There is considerable inherent patient-to-patient variability in the systemic availability of melphalan in patients with normal renal function.</p>
<p>b)Â Â Â Only a small amount of the administered dose appears as parent drug in the urine of patients with normal renal function.</p>
<p>Patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4261202" conceptname="Uremia">azotemia</span> should be closely observed, however, in order to make dosage reductions, if required, at the earliest possible time.</p>
<p>Administration of live vaccines to immunocompromised patients should be avoided.</p>

<h2>Information for Patients</h2>
<p class="First">Patients should be informed that the major toxicities of ALKERAN are related to bone marrow suppression, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity reactions</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="197596" conceptname="Toxic gastroenteritis">gastrointestinal toxicity</span>, and pulmonary toxicity.

<h2>Geriatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">Clinical studies of ALKERAN Tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p>

<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<p class="First"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">Overdoses</span>, including doses up to 50Â mg/day for 16Â days, have been reported. Immediate effects are likely to be <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, ulceration of the mouth, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">hemorrhage</span> of the gastrointestinal tract. The principal toxic effect is bone marrow suppression. Hematologic parameters should be closely followed for 3 to 6Â weeks. An uncontrolled study suggests that administration of autologous bone marrow or hematopoietic growth factors (i.e., sargramostim, filgrastim) may shorten the period of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432881" conceptname="Pancytopenia">pancytopenia</span>. General supportive measures, together with appropriate blood transfusions and antibiotics, should be instituted as deemed necessary by the physician. This drug is not removed from plasma to any significant degree by hemodialysis. </p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="i4i_section_id_73b89bb7-5b70-4107-9771-2f2680e3745c"></a><a name="section-9.1"></a><p></p>
<h2><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437233" conceptname="Multiple myeloma">Multiple Myeloma</span></h2>
<p class="First">The usual oral dose is 6Â mg (3Â tablets) daily. The entire daily dose may be given at one time. The dose is adjusted, as required, on the basis of blood counts done at approximately weekly intervals. After 2 to 3Â weeks of treatment, the drug should be discontinued for up to 4Â weeks, during which time the blood count should be followed carefully. When the white blood cell and platelet counts are rising, a maintenance dose of 2Â mg daily may be instituted. Because of the patient-to-patient variation in melphalan plasma levels following oral administration of the drug, several investigators have recommended that the dosage of ALKERAN be cautiously escalated until some <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4145241" conceptname="Bone marrow depression">myelosuppression</span> is observed in order to assure that potentially therapeutic levels of the drug have been reached.</p>
<p>Other dosage regimens have been used by various investigators. Osserman and Takatsuki have used an initial course of 10Â mg/day for 7 to 10Â days. They report that maximal suppression of the leukocyte and platelet counts occurs within 3 to 5Â weeks and recovery within 4 to 8Â weeks. Continuous maintenance therapy with 2Â mg/day is instituted when the white blood cell count is greater than 4,000Â cells/mcL and the platelet count is greater than 100,000Â cells/mcL. Dosage is adjusted to between 1 and 3Â mg/day depending upon the hematological response. It is desirable to try to maintain a significant degree of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4145241" conceptname="Bone marrow depression">bone marrow depression</span> so as to keep the leukocyte count in the range of 3,000 to 3,500Â cells/mcL.</p>
<p>Hoogstraten et al have started treatment with 0.15Â mg/kg/day for 7Â days. This is followed by a rest period of at least 14Â days, but it may be as long as 5 to 6Â weeks. Maintenance therapy is started when the white blood cell and platelet counts are rising. The maintenance dose is 0.05Â mg/kg/day or less and is adjusted according to the blood count.</p>
<p>Available evidence suggests that about one third to one half of the patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437233" conceptname="Multiple myeloma">multiple myeloma</span> show a favorable response to oral administration of the drug.</p>
<p>One study by Alexanian et al has shown that the use of ALKERAN in combination with prednisone significantly improves the percentage of patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437233" conceptname="Multiple myeloma">multiple myeloma</span> who achieve palliation. One regimen has been to administer courses of ALKERAN at 0.25Â mg/kg/day for 4Â consecutive days (or, 0.20Â mg/kg/day for 5Â consecutive days) for a total dose of 1Â mg/kg/course. These 4- to 5-day courses are then repeated every 4 to 6Â weeks if the granulocyte count and the platelet count have returned to normal levels.</p>
<p>It is to be emphasized that response may be very gradual over many months; it is important that repeated courses or continuous therapy be given since improvement may continue slowly over many months, and the maximum benefit may be missed if treatment is abandoned too soon.</p>
<p>In patients with moderate to severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span>, currently available pharmacokinetic data do not justify an absolute recommendation on dosage reduction to those patients, but it may be prudent to use a reduced dose initially.</p>

<h2>Epithelial Ovarian Cancer</h2>
<p class="First">One commonly employed regimen for the treatment of ovarian carcinoma has been to administer ALKERAN at a dose of 0.2Â mg/kg daily for 5Â days as a single course. Courses are repeated every 4 to 5Â weeks depending upon hematologic tolerance.</p>
