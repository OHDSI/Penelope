<h2>GI Effects</h2>
<p class="First">Famotidine is a competitive inhibitor of histamine H<span class="Sub">2</span>-receptors. The primary clinically important pharmacologic activity of famotidine is inhibition of gastric secretion. Both the acid concentration and volume of gastric secretion are suppressed by famotidine, while changes in pepsin secretion are proportional to volume output.</p>
<p>In normal volunteers and hypersecretors, famotidine inhibited basal and nocturnal gastric secretion, as well as secretion stimulated by food and pentagastrin. After oral administration, the onset of the antisecretory effect occurred within one hour; the maximum effect was dose-dependent, occurring within one to three hours. Duration of inhibition of secretion by doses of <br>20 and 40 mg was 10 to 12 hours.</p>
<p>Single evening oral doses of 20 and 40 mg inhibited basal and nocturnal acid secretion in all subjects; mean nocturnal gastric acid secretion was inhibited by 86% and 94%, respectively, for a period of at least 10 hours. The same doses given in the morning suppressed food-stimulated acid secretion in all subjects.  The mean suppression was 76% and 84%, respectively, 3 to 5 hours after administration, and 25% and 30%, respectively, 8 to 10 hours after administration. In some subjects who received the 20 mg dose, however, the antisecretory effect was dissipated within 6-8 hours. There was no cumulative effect with repeated doses. The nocturnal intragastric pH was raised by evening doses of 20 and 40 mg of famotidine to mean values of 5.0 and 6.4, respectively. When famotidine was given after breakfast, the basal daytime interdigestive pH at 3 and 8 hours after 20 or 40 mg of famotidine was raised to about 5.</p>
<p>Famotidine had little or no effect on fasting or postprandial serum gastrin levels. Gastric emptying and exocrine pancreatic function were not affected by famotidine.</p>

<h2>Other Effects</h2>
<p class="First">Systemic effects of famotidine in the CNS, cardiovascular, respiratory or endocrine systems were not noted in clinical pharmacology studies. Also, no antiandrogenic effects were noted. (See ADVERSE REACTIONS.) Serum hormone levels, including prolactin, cortisol, thyroxine (T<span class="Sub">4</span>), and testosterone, were not altered after treatment with famotidine.</p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
<p class="First">Famotidine is incompletely absorbed. The bioavailability of oral doses is 40-45%.  Bioavailability may be slightly increased by food, or slightly decreased by antacids; however, these effects are of no clinical consequence. Famotidine undergoes minimal first-pass metabolism.  The peak plasma concentration is reached about 2½ hours after administration of FLUXID™.  Plasma levels after multiple doses are similar to those after single doses. Fifteen to 20% of famotidine in plasma is protein bound.  The elimination half-life of famotidine is approximately 5 hours after administration of FLUXID™.  Famotidine is eliminated by renal (65-70%) and metabolic (30-35%) routes.  Renal clearance is 250 - 450 mL/min, indicating some tubular excretion.  Twenty-five to 30% of an oral dose and 65-70% of an intravenous dose are recovered in the urine as unchanged compound. The only metabolite identified in man is the S-oxide.</p>
<p>There is a close relationship between creatinine clearance values and the elimination half-life of famotidine.  In patients with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal insufficiency</span>, i.e., creatinine clearance less than <br>10 mL/min, the elimination half-life of famotidine may exceed 20 hours and adjustment of dose or dosing intervals in moderate and severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal insufficiency</span> may be necessary (see PRECAUTIONS, DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).</p>
<p>In elderly patients, there are no clinically significant age-related changes in the pharmacokinetics of famotidine.  However, in elderly patients with decreased renal function, the clearance of the drug may be decreased (see PRECAUTIONS, <span class="Italics">Geriatric Use</span>).</p>

<h2>Drug interactions</h2>
<p class="First">No drug interactions have been identified. Studies with famotidine in man, in animal models, and <span class="Italics">in vitro </span>have shown no significant interference with the disposition of compounds metabolized by the hepatic microsomal enzymes, e.g., cytochrome P450 system. Compounds tested in man include warfarin, theophylline, phenytoin, diazepam, aminopyrine and antipyrine. Indocyanine green as an index of hepatic drug extraction has been tested and no significant effects have been found.</p>

<h2>Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility</h2>
<p class="First">In a 106 week study in rats and a 92 week study in mice given oral doses of up to <br>2000 mg/kg/day (approximately 405 times in rats, and 203 times in mice, the recommended maximum human dose based on body surface area), there was no evidence of carcinogenic potential for famotidine.</p>
<p>Famotidine was negative in the Ames test, the mouse micronucleus test and the mouse chromosomal aberration test.</p>
<p>In studies with rats given oral doses of up to 2000 mg/kg/day (approximately 405 times the recommended maximum human dose based on body surface area), fertility and reproductive performance were not affected.</p>

<h2>Pregnancy.  Teratogenic Effects:  Pregnancy Category B</h2>
<p class="First">Reproductive studies have been performed at oral doses of up to 2000 mg/kg/day in rat (approximately 405 times the recommended maximum human dose based on body surface area) and 500 mg/kg/day in rabbit (approximately 203 times the recommended maximum human dose based on body surface area), and have revealed no significant evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to famotidine. There are, however, no adequate or well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproductive studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.</p>

<h2>Pediatric Patients 6-16 years of age</h2>
<p class="First">Use of famotidine in pediatric patients 6-16 years of age is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of famotidine in adults, and by the following studies in pediatric patients: In published studies in small numbers of pediatric patients 1-15 years of age, clearance of famotidine was similar to that seen in adults. In pediatric patients 11-15 years of age, oral doses of 0.5 mg/kg were associated with a mean area under the curve (AUC) similar to that seen in adults treated orally with 40 mg. Limited published studies also suggest that the relationship between serum concentration and acid suppression is similar in pediatric patients 1-15 years of age as compared with adults. These studies suggest a starting dose for pediatric patients 6 - 16 years of age as follows:</p>
<p><span class="Italics"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318800" conceptname="Gastroesophageal reflux disease">Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease</span> with or without <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="30753" conceptname="Esophagitis">esophagitis</span> including erosions and <br>ulcerations </span>- 1.0 mg/kg/day p.o. divided b.i.d. up to 40 mg b.i.d.</p>
<p>While published uncontrolled studies suggest effectiveness of famotidine in the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318800" conceptname="Gastroesophageal reflux disease">gastroesophageal reflux disease</span>, data in pediatric patients are insufficient to establish percent response with dose and duration of therapy. Therefore, treatment duration (initially based on adult duration recommendations) and dose should be individualized based on clinical response and/or pH determination (gastric or esophageal) and endoscopy. Published uncontrolled clinical studies in pediatric patients have employed doses up to 2 mg/kg/day for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318800" conceptname="Gastroesophageal reflux disease">GERD</span> with or without <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="30753" conceptname="Esophagitis">esophagitis</span> including erosions and ulcerations.</p>

<h2>Geriatric use</h2>
<p class="First">Of the 4,966 subjects in clinical studies who were treated with famotidine, 488 subjects (9.8%) were 65 and older, and 88 subjects (1.7%) were greater than 75 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects. However, greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.</p>
<p>No dosage adjustment is required based on age (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY IN ADULTS, <span class="Italics">Pharmacokinetics</span>). This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span>. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Dosage adjustment in the case of moderate or severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> is necessary (see PRECAUTIONS, <span class="Italics">Patients with Moderate or Severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">Renal Insufficiency</span> </span>and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, <span class="Italics">Dosage Adjustment for Patients with Moderate or Severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">Renal Insufficiency</span></span>).</p>

<h2>Dosage for Pediatric Patients 6-16 years of age</h2>
<p class="First">See PRECAUTIONS, <span class="Italics">Pediatric Patients 6-16 years of age.</span></p>
<p>The studies described in PRECAUTIONS, <span class="Italics">Pediatric Patients 6-16 years of age </span>suggest the following starting doses in pediatric patients 6-16 years of age:</p>
<p><span class="Italics"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318800" conceptname="Gastroesophageal reflux disease">Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease</span> with or without <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="30753" conceptname="Esophagitis">esophagitis</span> including erosions and <br>ulcerations </span>- 1.0 mg/kg/day p.o. divided b.i.d. up to 40 mg b.i.d.</p>
<p>Tablet should not be broken.</p>
<p>While published uncontrolled studies suggest effectiveness of famotidine in the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318800" conceptname="Gastroesophageal reflux disease">gastroesophageal reflux disease</span>, data in pediatric patients are insufficient to establish percent response with dose and duration of therapy. Therefore, treatment duration (initially based on adult duration recommendations) and dose should be individualized based on clinical response and/or pH determination (gastric or esophageal) and endoscopy. Published uncontrolled clinical studies in pediatric patients 1-16 years of age have employed doses up to 2 mg/kg/day for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318800" conceptname="Gastroesophageal reflux disease">GERD</span> with or without <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="30753" conceptname="Esophagitis">esophagitis</span> including erosions and ulcerations.</p>

<h2>Pathological Hypersecretory Conditions (e.g., Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome, Multiple Endocrine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106411" conceptname="Adenofibroma">Adenomas</span>)</h2>
<p class="First">The dosage of famotidine in patients with pathological hypersecretory conditions varies with the individual patient. The recommended adult oral starting dose for pathological hypersecretory conditions is 20 mg q 6 h. In some patients, a higher starting dose may be required. Doses should be adjusted to individual patient needs and should continue as long as clinically indicated. Doses up to 160 mg q 6 h have been administered to some adult patients with severe Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome.</p>

<h2>Dosage Adjustment for Patients with Moderate or Severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">Renal Insufficiency</span></h2>
<p class="First">In adult patients with moderate (creatinine clearance &lt;50 mL/min) or severe (creatinine clearance &lt;10 mL/min) <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal insufficiency</span>, the elimination half-life of famotidine is increased. For patients with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal insufficiency</span>, it may exceed 20 hours, reaching approximately 24 hours in anuric patients. Since CNS adverse effects have been reported in patients with moderate and severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal insufficiency</span>, to avoid excess accumulation of the drug in patients with moderate or severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal insufficiency</span>, the dose of FLUXID™ may be reduced to half the dose or the dosing interval may be prolonged to 36-48 hours as indicated by the patient’s clinical response.</p>
<p>Based on the comparison of pharmacokinetic parameters for famotidine in adults and pediatric patients, dosage adjustment in pediatric patients with moderate or severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal insufficiency</span> should be considered.</p>
