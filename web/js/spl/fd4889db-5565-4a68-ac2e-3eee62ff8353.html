<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<div class="Section">
<a name="section-2.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>Mechanism of Action</h2>
<p class="First">Lisinopril inhibits angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in human subjects and animals.  ACE is a peptidyl dipeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance, angiotensin II.  Angiotensin II also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex.  The beneficial effects of lisinopril in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span> appear to result primarily from suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.  Inhibition of ACE results in decreased plasma angiotensin II which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and to decreased aldosterone secretion.  The latter decrease may result in a small increase of serum potassium.  In hypertensive patients with normal renal function treated with ZESTRIL alone for up to 24 weeks, the mean increase in serum potassium was approximately 0.1 mEq/L; however, approximately 15% of patients had increases greater than 0.5 mEq/L and approximately 6% had a decrease greater than 0.5 mEq/L.  In the same study, patients treated with ZESTRIL and hydrochlorothiazide for up to 24 weeks had a mean decrease in serum potassium of 0.1 mEq/L; approximately 4% of patients had increases greater than 0.5 mEq/L and approximately 12% had a decrease greater than 0.5 mEq/L  (See <a href="#springac1131051583523">PRECAUTIONS</a>). Removal of angiotensin II negative feedback on renin secretion leads to increased plasma renin activity.</p>
<p>ACE is identical to kininase, an enzyme that degrades bradykinin.  Whether increased levels of bradykinin, a potent vasodepressor peptide, play a role in the therapeutic effects of ZESTRIL remains to be elucidated.</p>
<p>While the mechanism through which ZESTRIL lowers blood pressure is believed to be primarily suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, ZESTRIL is antihypertensive even in patients with low-renin <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>.  Although ZESTRIL was antihypertensive in all races studied, Black hypertensive patients (usually a low-renin hypertensive population) had a smaller average response to monotherapy than non-Black patients.</p>
<p>Concomitant administration of ZESTRIL and hydrochlorothiazide further reduced blood pressure in Black and non-Black patients and any racial differences in blood pressure response were no longer evident.</p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adult Patients:</span> Following oral administration of ZESTRIL, peak serum concentrations of lisinopril occur within about 7 hours, although there was a trend to a small delay in time taken to reach peak serum concentrations in acute myocardial  <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4206471" conceptname="Infarct">infarction</span> patients.  Declining serum concentrations exhibit a prolonged terminal phase which does not contribute to drug accumulation.  This terminal phase probably represents saturable binding to ACE and is not proportional to dose.</p>
<p>Lisinopril does not appear to be bound to other serum proteins.  Lisinopril does not undergo metabolism and is excreted unchanged entirely in the urine. Based on urinary recovery, the mean extent of absorption of lisinopril is approximately 25%, with large intersubject variability (6%-60%) at all doses tested (5-80 mg).  Lisinopril absorption is not influenced by the presence of food in the gastrointestinal tract.  The absolute bioavailability of lisinopril is reduced to 16% in patients with stable NYHA Class II-IV <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319835" conceptname="Congestive heart failure">congestive heart failure</span>, and the volume of distribution appears to be slightly smaller than that in normal subjects. The oral bioavailability of lisinopril in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312327" conceptname="Acute myocardial infarction">acute myocardial infarction</span> is similar to that in healthy volunteers.</p>
<p>Upon multiple dosing, lisinopril exhibits an effective half-life of accumulation of 12 hours.</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">Impaired renal function</span> decreases elimination of lisinopril, which is excreted principally through the kidneys, but this decrease becomes clinically important only when the glomerular filtration rate is below 30 mL/min.  Above this glomerular filtration rate, the elimination half-life is little changed.  With greater impairment, however, peak and trough lisinopril levels increase, time to peak concentration increases and time to attain steady state is prolonged. Older patients, on average, have (approximately doubled) higher blood levels and area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) than younger patients  (See <a href="#springac1131051602539">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>).  Lisinopril can be removed by hemodialysis.</p>
<p>Studies in rats indicate that lisinopril crosses the blood-brain barrier poorly.  Multiple doses of lisinopril in rats do not result in accumulation in any tissues.  Milk of lactating rats contains radioactivity following administration of <span class="Sup">14</span>C lisinopril.  By whole body autoradiography, radioactivity was found in the placenta following administration of labeled drug to pregnant rats, but none was found in the fetuses.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Pediatric Patients:</span>  The pharmacokinetics of lisinopril were studied in 29 pediatric hypertensive patients between 6 years and 16 years with glomerular filtration rate &gt; 30 mL/min/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span>.  After doses of 0.1 to 0.2 mg/kg, steady state peak plasma concentrations of lisinopril occurred within 6 hours and the extent of absorption based on urinary recovery was about 28%.  These values are similar to those obtained previously in adults.  The typical value of lisinopril oral clearance (systemic clearance/absolute bioavailability) in a child weighing 30 kg is 10 L/h, which increases in proportion to renal function.</p>

<a name="section-2.4"></a><p></p>
<h2><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">Hypertension</span></h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adult Patients:</span>  Administration of ZESTRIL to patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> results in a reduction of both supine and standing blood pressure to about the same extent with no compensatory <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">tachycardia</span>.  Symptomatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319041" conceptname="Orthostatic hypotension">postural hypotension</span> is usually not observed although it can occur and should be anticipated in volume and/or salt-depleted patients (See <a href="#springac1131051565132">WARNINGS</a>).  When given together with thiazide-type diuretics, the blood pressure lowering effects of the two drugs are approximately additive.</p>
<p>In most patients studied, onset of antihypertensive activity was seen at one hour after oral administration of an individual dose of ZESTRIL, with peak reduction of blood pressure achieved by 6 hours.  Although an antihypertensive effect was observed 24 hours after dosing with recommended single daily doses, the effect was more consistent and the mean effect was considerably larger in some studies with doses of 20 mg or more than with lower doses; however, at all doses studied, the mean antihypertensive effect was substantially smaller 24 hours after dosing than it was 6 hours after dosing. </p>
<p>In some patients achievement of optimal blood pressure reduction may require two to four weeks of therapy.   </p>
<p>The antihypertensive effects of ZESTRIL are maintained during long-term therapy.  Abrupt withdrawal of ZESTRIL has not been associated with a rapid increase in blood pressure, or a significant increase in blood pressure compared to pretreatment levels.</p>
<p>Two dose-response studies utilizing a once-daily regimen were conducted in 438 mild to moderate hypertensive patients not on a diuretic.  Blood pressure was measured 24 hours after dosing.  An antihypertensive effect of ZESTRIL was seen with 5 mg in some patients. However, in both studies blood pressure reduction occurred sooner and was greater in patients treated with 10, 20 or 80 mg of ZESTRIL.  In controlled clinical studies, ZESTRIL 20-80 mg has been compared in patients with mild to moderate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> to hydrochlorothiazide 12.5-50 mg and with atenolol 50-200 mg; and in patients with moderate to severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> to metoprolol 100-200 mg.  It was superior to hydrochlorothiazide in effects on systolic and diastolic pressure in a population that was 3/4 Caucasian.  ZESTRIL was approximately equivalent to atenolol and metoprolol in effects on diastolic blood pressure, and had somewhat greater effects on systolic blood pressure.</p>
<p>ZESTRIL had similar effectiveness and adverse effects in younger and older (&gt; 65 years) patients.  It was less effective in Blacks than in Caucasians.</p>
<p>In hemodynamic studies in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="320128" conceptname="Essential hypertension">essential hypertension</span>, blood pressure reduction was accompanied by a reduction in peripheral arterial resistance with little or no change in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4221102" conceptname="Cardiac output">cardiac output</span> and in heart rate.  In a study in nine hypertensive patients, following administration of ZESTRIL, there was an increase in mean renal blood flow that was not significant.  Data from several small studies are inconsistent with respect to the effect of lisinopril on glomerular filtration rate in hypertensive patients with normal renal function, but suggest that changes, if any, are not large.</p>
<p>In patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317895" conceptname="Renovascular hypertension">renovascular hypertension</span> ZESTRIL has been shown to be well tolerated and effective in controlling blood pressure  (See <a href="#springac1131051583523">PRECAUTIONS</a>).</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Pediatric Patients:</span>  In a clinical study involving 115 hypertensive pediatric patients 6 to 16 years of age, patients who weighed &lt; 50 kg received either 0.625, 2.5 or 20 mg of lisinopril daily and patients who weighed ≥ 50 kg received either 1.25, 5, or 40 mg of lisinopril daily.  At the end of 2 weeks, lisinopril administered once daily lowered trough blood pressure in a dose-dependent manner with consistent antihypertensive efficacy demonstrated at doses &gt; 1.25 mg (0.02 mg/kg).  This effect was confirmed in a withdrawal phase, where the diastolic pressure rose by about 9 mmHg more in patients randomized to placebo than it did in patients who were randomized to remain on the middle and high doses of lisinopril.  The dose-dependent antihypertensive effect of lisinopril was consistent across several demographic subgroups:  age, Tanner stage, gender, and race.  In this study, lisinopril was generally well—tolerated.</p>
<p>In the above pediatric studies, lisinopril was given either as tablets or in a suspension for those children and infants who were unable to swallow tablets or who required a lower dose than is available in tablet form  (see <a href="#springac1131051602539">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>, <span class="Italics">Preparation of Suspension</span>).</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">Heart Failure</span>:</span>  During baseline-controlled clinical trials, in patients receiving digitalis and diuretics, single doses of ZESTRIL resulted in decreases in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, systemic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4089490" conceptname="Vascular resistance">vascular resistance</span> and blood pressure accompanied by an increase in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4221102" conceptname="Cardiac output">cardiac output</span> and no change in heart rate.</p>
<p> In two placebo controlled, 12-week clinical studies using doses of ZESTRIL up to 20 mg, ZESTRIL as adjunctive therapy to digitalis and diuretics improved the following signs and symptoms due to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319835" conceptname="Congestive heart failure">congestive heart failure</span>:  <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433595" conceptname="Edema">edema</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4167669" conceptname="Respiratory crackles">rales</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4206307" conceptname="Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea">paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea</span> and jugular venous <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4218984" conceptname="Abdominal distension">distention</span>.  In one of the studies, beneficial response was also noted for:  <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315361" conceptname="Orthopnea">orthopnea</span>, presence of third heart sound and the number of patients classified as NYHA Class III and IV.  Exercise tolerance was also improved in this study. The once-daily dosing for the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319835" conceptname="Congestive heart failure">congestive heart failure</span> was the only dosage regimen used during clinical trial development and was determined by the measurement of hemodynamic response.  A large (over 3000 patients) survival study, the ATLAS Trial, comparing 2.5 and 35 mg of lisinopril in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span>, showed that the higher dose of lisinopril had outcomes at least as favorable as the lower dose.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312327" conceptname="Acute myocardial infarction">Acute Myocardial Infarction</span>:</span>  The Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Sopravvienza nell’Infarto Miocardico (GISSI-3) study was a multicenter, controlled, randomized, unblinded clinical trial conducted in 19,394 patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312327" conceptname="Acute myocardial infarction">acute myocardial infarction</span> admitted to a coronary care unit.  It was designed to examine the effects of short-term (6 week) treatment with lisinopril, nitrates, their combination, or no therapy on short-term (6 week) mortality and on long—term <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> and markedly impaired cardiac function.  Patients presenting within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms who were hemodynamically stable were randomized, in a 2 x 2 factorial design, to six weeks of either 1) ZESTRIL alone (n=4841), 2) nitrates alone (n=4869), 3) ZESTRIL plus nitrates (n=4841), or 4) open control (n=4843).  All patients received routine therapies, including thrombolytics (72%), aspirin (84%), and a beta-blocker (31%), as appropriate, normally utilized in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312327" conceptname="Acute myocardial infarction">acute myocardial infarction</span> (MI) patients.</p>
<p>The protocol excluded patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> (systolic blood pressure ≤ 100 mmHg), severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198571" conceptname="Cardiogenic shock">cardiogenic shock</span>, and renal dysfunction (serum creatinine &gt;2 mg/dL and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75650" conceptname="Proteinuria">proteinuria</span> &gt; 500 mg/24 h).  Doses of ZESTRIL were adjusted as necessary according to protocol (See <a href="#springac1131051602539">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>).</p>
<p>Study treatment was withdrawn at six weeks except where clinical conditions indicated continuation of treatment.</p>

<p>Patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312327" conceptname="Acute myocardial infarction">acute myocardial infarction</span>, treated with ZESTRIL, had a higher (9.0% versus 3.7%) incidence of persistent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> (systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mmHg for more than 1 hour) and renal dysfunction (2.4% versus 1.1%) in-hospital and at six weeks (increasing creatinine concentration to over 3 mg/dL or a doubling or more of the baseline serum creatinine concentration).

<p>In patients at risk of excessive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, therapy should be started under very close medical supervision and such patients should be followed closely for the first two weeks of treatment and whenever the dose of ZESTRIL and/or diuretic is increased.

<h2>Fetal/Neonatal Morbidity and Mortality</h2>
<p class="First">ACE inhibitors can cause fetal and neonatal morbidity and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> when administered to pregnant women.  Several dozen cases have been reported in the world literature.  When pregnancy is detected, ACE inhibitors should be discontinued as soon as possible.</p>
<p>In a published retrospective epidemiological study, infants whose mothers had taken an ACE inhibitor drug during the first trimester of pregnancy appeared to have an increased risk of major congenital malformations compared with infants whose mothers had not undergone first trimester exposure to ACE inhibitor drugs. The number of cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4029540" conceptname="Congenital anomaly">birth defects</span> is small and the findings of this study have not yet been repeated.</p>
<p>The use of ACE inhibitors during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy has been associated with fetal and neonatal injury, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, neonatal skull hypoplasia, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4090272" conceptname="Anuria">anuria</span>, reversible or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198185" conceptname="Chronic renal failure">irreversible renal failure</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>.  <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434111" conceptname="Oligohydramnios">Oligohydramnios</span> has also been reported, presumably resulting from decreased fetal renal function; <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434111" conceptname="Oligohydramnios">oligohydramnios</span> in this setting has been associated with fetal limb <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208264" conceptname="Muscle contracture">contractures</span>, craniofacial deformation, and hypoplastic lung development.  <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439128" conceptname="Extreme immaturity">Prematurity</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80204" conceptname="Fetal growth restriction">intrauterine growth retardation</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315922" conceptname="Patent ductus arteriosus">patent ductus arteriosus</span> have also been reported, although it is not clear whether these occurrences were due to the ACE-inhibitor exposure.</p>
<p>These adverse effects do not appear to have resulted from intrauterine ACE-inhibitor exposure that has been limited to the first trimester.  Mothers whose embryos and fetuses are exposed to ACE inhibitors only during the first trimester should be so informed.  Nonetheless, when patients become pregnant, physicians should make every effort to discontinue the use of ZESTRIL as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Rarely (probably less often than once in every thousand pregnancies), no alternative to ACE inhibitors will be found.  In these rare cases, the mothers should be apprised of the potential hazards to their fetuses, and serial ultrasound examinations should be performed to assess the intraamniotic environment.</p>
<p>If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434111" conceptname="Oligohydramnios">oligohydramnios</span> is observed, ZESTRIL should be discontinued unless it is considered lifesaving for the mother.  Contraction stress testing (CST), a nonstress test (NST), or biophysical profiling (BPP) may be appropriate, depending upon the week of pregnancy.  Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434111" conceptname="Oligohydramnios">oligohydramnios</span> may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury.</p>
<p>Infants with histories of <span class="Italics">in utero</span> exposure to ACE inhibitors should be closely observed for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306451" conceptname="Oliguria">oliguria</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434610" conceptname="Hyperkalemia">hyperkalemia</span>.  If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306451" conceptname="Oliguria">oliguria</span> occurs, attention should be directed toward support of blood pressure and renal perfusion.  Exchange transfusion or dialysis may be required as means of reversing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> and/or substituting for disordered renal function.  Lisinopril, which crosses the placenta, has been removed from neonatal circulation by peritoneal dialysis with some clinical benefit, and theoretically may be removed by exchange transfusion, although there is no experience with the latter procedure.</p>
<p>No teratogenic effects of lisinopril were seen in studies of pregnant rats, mice, and rabbits.  On a mg/kg basis, the doses used were up to 625 times (in mice), 188 times (in rats), and 0.6 times (in rabbits) the maximum recommended human dose.</p>

<h2>Drug Interactions</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">Hypotension</span> - Patients on Diuretic Therapy:</span>  Patients on diuretics and especially those in whom diuretic therapy was recently instituted, may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of therapy with ZESTRIL.  The possibility of hypotensive effects with ZESTRIL can be minimized by either discontinuing the diuretic or increasing the salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with ZESTRIL.  If it is necessary to continue the diuretic, initiate therapy with ZESTRIL at a dose of 5 mg daily, and provide close medical supervision after the initial dose until blood pressure has stabilized (See <a href="#springac1131051565132">WARNINGS</a>, and <a href="#springac1131051602539">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>).  When a diuretic is added to the therapy of a patient receiving ZESTRIL, an additional antihypertensive effect is usually observed.  Studies with ACE inhibitors in combination with diuretics indicate that the dose of the ACE inhibitor can be reduced when it is given with a diuretic (See <a href="#springac1131051602539">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>).</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Antidiabetics:</span> Epidemiological studies have suggested that concomitant administration of ACE inhibitors and antidiabetic medicines (insulins, oral hypoglycemic agents) may cause an increased blood-glucose-lowering effect with risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span>. This phenomenon appeared to be more likely to occur during the first weeks of combined treatment and in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span>. In diabetic patients treated with oral antidiabetic agents or insulin, glycemic control should be closely monitored for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span>, especially during the first month of treatment with an ACE inhibitor.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors):</span> In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with ACE inhibitors, including lisinopril, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="197320" conceptname="Acute renal failure syndrome">acute renal failure</span>. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving lisinopril and NSAID therapy.</p>
<p>The antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors, including lisinopril, may be attenuated by NSAIDs.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Other Agents: </span> ZESTRIL has been used concomitantly with nitrates and/or digoxin without evidence of clinically significant adverse interactions.  This included post <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span> patients who were receiving intravenous or transdermal nitroglycerin.  No clinically important <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196500" conceptname="Drug interaction">pharmacokinetic interactions</span> occurred when ZESTRIL was used concomitantly with propranolol or hydrochlorothiazide.  The presence of food in the stomach does not alter the bioavailability of ZESTRIL.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Agents Increasing Serum Potassium: </span> ZESTRIL attenuates potassium loss caused by thiazide-type diuretics.  Use of ZESTRIL with potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g., spironolactone, eplerenone, triamterene or amiloride), potassium supplements, or potassium-containing salt substitutes may lead to significant increases in serum potassium.  Therefore, if concomitant use of these agents is indicated because of demonstrated <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437833" conceptname="Hypokalemia">hypokalemia</span>, they should be used with caution and with frequent monitoring of serum potassium.  Potassium-sparing agents should generally not be used in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span> who are receiving ZESTRIL.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Lithium:</span>  <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433667" conceptname="Poisoning by tetanus vaccine">Lithium toxicity</span> has been reported in patients receiving lithium concomitantly with drugs which cause elimination of sodium, including ACE inhibitors.  <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433667" conceptname="Poisoning by tetanus vaccine">Lithium toxicity</span> was usually reversible upon discontinuation of lithium and the ACE inhibitor.  It is recommended that serum lithium levels be monitored frequently if ZESTRIL is administered concomitantly with lithium.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Gold:</span> Nitritoid reactions (symptoms include <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318566" conceptname="Flushing">facial flushing</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>) have been reported rarely in patients on therapy with injectable gold (sodium aurothiomalate) and concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy including ZESTRIL.</p>

<h2>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h2>
<p class="First">There was no evidence of a tumorigenic effect when lisinopril was administered for 105 weeks to male and female rats at doses up to 90 mg/kg/day (about 56 or 9 times<a name="footnote-reference-1" href="#footnote-1" class="Sup">1</a> the maximum recommended daily human dose, based on body weight and body surface area, respectively).  There was no evidence of carcinogenicity when lisinopril was administered for 92 weeks to (male and female) mice at doses up to 135 mg/kg/day (about 84 times<a href="#footnote-1" class="Sup">1</a> the maximum recommended daily human dose).  This dose was 6.8 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area in mice.</p>
<p>Lisinopril was not mutagenic in the Ames microbial mutagen test with or without metabolic activation.  It was also negative in a forward mutation assay using Chinese hamster lung cells.  Lisinopril did not produce single strand DNA breaks in an <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> alkaline elution rat hepatocyte assay.  In addition, lisinopril did not produce increases in chromosomal aberrations in an <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> test in Chinese hamster ovary cells or in an <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> study in mouse bone marrow. </p>
<p>There were no adverse effects on reproductive performance in male and female rats treated with up to 300 mg/kg/day of lisinopril.   This dose is 188 times and 30 times the maximum human dose when based on mg/kg and mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>, respectively.</p>

<h2>Geriatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">Clinical studies of ZESTRIL in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.  Other clinical experience in this population has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.  In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. </p>
<p>In the ATLAS trial of ZESTRIL in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319835" conceptname="Congestive heart failure">congestive heart failure</span>, 1,596 (50%) were 65 and over, while 437 (14%) were 75 and over.

In these studies, no overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between elderly and younger patients, and other reported clinical experiences has not identified  differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacodynamics and Clinical Effects,<a href="#springac1131052256710"> <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">Heart Failure</span></a> and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacodynamics and Clinical Effects, <a href="#springac1131052347445"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312327" conceptname="Acute myocardial infarction">Acute Myocardial Infarction</span></a>).</p>
<p>Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. </p>
<p>Pharmacokinetic studies indicate that maximum blood levels and area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) are doubled in older patients (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, <a href="#springac1131052167085">Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism</a>). </p>

<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Initial Therapy: </span> In patients with uncomplicated <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="320128" conceptname="Essential hypertension">essential hypertension</span> not on diuretic therapy, the recommended initial dose is 10 mg once a day.  Dosage should be adjusted according to blood pressure response.  The usual dosage range is 20 to 40 mg per day administered in a single daily dose.  The antihypertensive effect may diminish toward the end of the dosing interval regardless of the administered dose, but most commonly with a dose of 10 mg daily.  This can be evaluated by measuring blood pressure just prior to dosing to determine whether satisfactory control is being maintained for 24 hours.  If it is not, an increase in dose should be considered.  Doses up to 80 mg have been used but do not appear to give greater effect.  If blood pressure is not controlled with ZESTRIL alone, a low dose of a diuretic may be added.  Hydrochlorothiazide, 12.5 mg has been shown to provide an additive effect.  After the addition of a diuretic, it may be possible to reduce the dose of ZESTRIL.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Diuretic Treated Patients</span>:  In hypertensive patients who are currently being treated with a diuretic, symptomatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> may occur occasionally following the initial dose of ZESTRIL.  The diuretic should be discontinued, if possible, for two to three days before beginning therapy with ZESTRIL to reduce the likelihood of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> (See <a href="#springac1131051565132">WARNINGS</a>). The dosage of ZESTRIL should be adjusted according to blood pressure response.  If the patient's blood pressure is not controlled with ZESTRIL alone, diuretic therapy may be resumed as described above. </p>
<p>If the diuretic cannot be discontinued, an initial dose of 5 mg should be used under medical supervision for at least two hours and until blood pressure has stabilized for at least an additional hour  (See <a href="#springac1131051565132">WARNINGS </a>and <a href="#springac1131051583523">PRECAUTIONS</a>, <a href="#springac1131051963007">Drug Interactions</a>).</p>
<p>Concomitant administration of ZESTRIL with potassium supplements, potassium salt substitutes, or potassium-sparing diuretics may lead to increases of serum potassium (See <a href="#springac1131051583523">PRECAUTIONS</a>).</p>

For patients with creatinine clearance ≥ 10 mL/min ≤ 30 mL/min (serum creatinine ≥ 3 mg/dL), the first dose is 5 mg once daily.  For patients with creatinine clearance &lt; 10 mL/min (usually on hemodialysis) the recommended initial dose is 2.5 mg.

<p class="First">ZESTRIL is indicated as adjunctive therapy with diuretics and (usually) digitalis. The recommended starting dose is 5 mg once a day.  When initiating treatment with lisinopril in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316139" conceptname="Heart failure">heart failure</span>, the initial dose should be administered under medical observation, especially in those patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">low blood pressure</span> (systolic blood pressure below 100 mmHg).  The mean peak blood pressure lowering occurs six to eight hours after dosing.  Observation should continue until blood pressure is stable.

The appearance of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> after the initial dose of ZESTRIL does not preclude subsequent careful dose titration with the drug, following effective management of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>.</p>
<p>The usual effective dosage range is 5 to 40 mg per day administered as a single daily dose. The dose of ZESTRIL can be increased by increments of  no greater than 10 mg, at intervals of no less than 2 weeks to the highest tolerated dose, up to a maximum of 40 mg daily.

<h2><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312327" conceptname="Acute myocardial infarction">Acute Myocardial Infarction</span></h2>
<p class="First">In hemodynamically stable patients within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312327" conceptname="Acute myocardial infarction">acute myocardial infarction</span>, the first dose of ZESTRIL is 5 mg given orally, followed by 5 mg after 24 hours, 10 mg after 48 hours and then 10 mg of ZESTRIL once daily.  Dosing should continue for six weeks.  Patients should receive, as appropriate, the standard recommended treatments such as thrombolytics, aspirin, and beta-blockers.</p>
<p>Patients with a low systolic blood pressure (≤ 120 mmHg) when treatment is started or during the first 3 days after the infarct should be given a lower 2.5 mg oral dose of ZESTRIL (See <a href="#springac1131051565132">WARNINGS</a>).  If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> occurs (systolic blood pressure ≤ 100 mmHg) a daily maintenance dose of 5 mg may be given with temporary reductions to 2.5 mg if needed.  If prolonged  <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> occurs (systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mmHg for more  than 1 hour) ZESTRIL should be withdrawn.

<h2>Use in Elderly</h2>
<p class="First">In general, the clinical response was similar in younger and older patients given similar doses of ZESTRIL. Pharmacokinetic studies, however indicate that maximum blood levels and area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) are doubled in older patients, so that dosage adjustments should be made with particular caution.</p>
