<h1>Description</h1>
<p class="First">KEMSTROâ„¢ (baclofen orally disintegrating tablets) is a muscle relaxant and antispastic. Baclofen USP is a white to off-white, odorless or practically odorless crystalline powder.  It is slightly soluble in water, very slightly soluble in methanol, and insoluble in chloroform.  Its chemical name is 4-amino-3-(4-chlorophenyl)-butanoic acid.  The molecular weight of baclofen is 213.66 and the empirical formula is C<span class="Sub">10</span>H<span class="Sub">12</span>CINO<span class="Sub">2</span>.  The structural formula is represented below:</p>

<p>KEMSTROâ„¢ is available as 10 mg and 20 mg orally disintegrating tablets.  Each orally disintegrating tablet also contains as inactive ingredients: aspartame, colloidal silicon dioxide, crospovidone, magnesium stearate, mannitol, microcrystalline cellulose, natural and artificial orange flavor and povidone.</p>

<h1>Clinical Pharmacology</h1>
<p class="First">The precise mechanism of action of baclofen is not fully known.  Baclofen is capable of inhibiting both monosynaptic and polysynaptic reflexes at the spinal level, possibly by hyperpolarization of afferent terminals, although actions at supraspinal sites may also occur and contribute to its clinical effect.  Although baclofen is an analog of the putative inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA), there is no conclusive evidence that actions on GABA systems are involved in the production of its clinical effects.  In studies with animals, baclofen has been shown to have general CNS depressant properties as indicated by the production of sedation with tolerance, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437584" conceptname="Ataxia">ataxia</span>, and respiratory and cardiovascular <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>.</p>

<h3>Absorption</h3>
<p class="First">Baclofen is rapidly and extensively absorbed.  Absorption may be dose-dependent, being reduced with increasing doses.  KEMSTROâ„¢ given with or without water is bioequivalent to the baclofen conventional tablet.  Thus KEMSTROâ„¢ can be placed on the tongue until it disintegrates and then be swallowed with or without water.  Following a single 20 mg oral dose of KEMSTROâ„¢, the peak plasma concentration was reached about 1Â½ hours after administration.</p>

<h3><span class="Italics">Distribution</span></h3>
<p class="First">The apparent volume of distribution is 59 liters.  Baclofen does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier.  Plasma protein binding is approximately 30%.</p>
</div>

<h3>Metabolism</h3>
<p class="First">In a study using radiolabeled baclofen, approximately 85% of the dose was excreted unchanged in the urine and feces.  About 15% of the dose was metabolized, primarily by deamination.  The Î³-hydroxy metabolite, 3-(<span class="Italics">p</span>-chlorophenyl)-4-hydroxybutyric acid, is formed after deamination of baclofen.  </p>

<h3>Excretion</h3>
<p class="First">Baclofen is rapidly and extensively eliminated.  There is a relatively large intersubject variation in elimination.  Baclofen is excreted primarily by the kidney as unchanged drug; 70 - 80% of a dose appears in the urine as unchanged drug.  The remainder is excreted as unchanged drug in the feces or as metabolites in the urine and feces.  Excretion is complete within 72 hours after administration.  The elimination half-life of KEMSTROâ„¢ is approximately 5Â½ hours.  Total systemic clearance is 180 mL/min and renal clearance is 103 mL/min.  </p>

<h3>Special Populations<br>Elderly</h3>
<p class="First">The pharmacokinetics of baclofen tablets were evaluated in elderly patients (69-81 years) and in healthy younger subjects (23-53 years) after a single 10 mg dose.  The C<span class="Sub">max</span> was lower (119 ng/mL vs. 178 ng/mL) and the T<span class="Sub">max</span> was longer (3 hours vs. 1 hour) in the elderly patients compared to the younger subjects.  The AUCs were similar in the two groups.  In this study, the elimination half-life was slightly prolonged in the elderly patients compared to the younger subjects, 4.43 hours vs. 3.75 hours, respectively.</p>

<h2>Information for patients</h2>
<p class="First">Because of the possibility of sedation, patients should be cautioned regarding the operation of automobiles or other dangerous machinery, and activities made hazardous by decreased alertness.  Patients should also be cautioned that the central nervous system depressant effects of baclofen may be additive to those of alcohol and other CNS depressants.</p>

This abnormality was not seen in mice or rabbits.  There was also an increased incidence of incomplete sternebral ossification in fetuses of rats given approximately 13 times the maximum recommended human dose, and an increased incidence of unossified phalangeal nuclei of forelimbs and hindlimbs in fetuses of rabbits given approximately 7 times the maximum recommended human dose.  In mice, no teratogenic effects were observed, although reductions in mean fetal weight with consequent delays in skeletal ossification were present when dams were given 17 or 34 times the human daily dose.  There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. KEMSTROâ„¢ should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p>

<h2>Geriatric use</h2>
<p class="First">Clinical studies of baclofen did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.  In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p>
<p>This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span>.  Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.</p>
<p>Sedating drugs may cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">confusion</span> and over-sedation in the elderly; elderly patients generally should be started on low doses of KEMSTROâ„¢ and observed closely.</p>

<h1>Dosage and Administration</h1>
<p class="First">The determination of optimal dosage requires individual titration.  Start therapy at a low dosage and increase gradually until optimum effect is achieved (usually between 40-80 mg daily).  </p>
<p>The following dosage titration schedule is suggested:</p>
<p>5 mg three times a day for 3 days</p>
<p>10 mg three times a day for 3 days</p>
<p>15 mg three times a day for 3 days</p>
<p>20 mg three times a day for 3 days</p>
<p>Thereafter additional increases may be necessary but the total daily dose should not exceed a maximum of 80 mg daily (20 mg four times a day).</p>
<p>The lowest dose compatible with an optimal response is recommended.  If benefits are not evident after a reasonable trial period, patients should be slowly withdrawn from the drug (see WARNINGS, <a href="#i4i_section_0AEE692F-9260-432F-8FB5-E7206BCC0F0B">Abrupt Drug Withdrawal</a>).</p>
