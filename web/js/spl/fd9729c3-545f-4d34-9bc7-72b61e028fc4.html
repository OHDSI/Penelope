</div>
<p>The solubility of pimozide in water is less than 0.01 mg/mL; it is slightly soluble in most organic solvents.</p>
<p>Each white ORAP tablet contains either 1 mg or 2 mg of pimozide and the following inactive ingredients: calcium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, lactose anhydrous and corn starch.</p>

<h2>Pharmacodynamic Actions</h2>
<p class="First">ORAP (pimozide) is an orally active antipsychotic drug product which shares with other antipsychotics the ability to blockade dopaminergic receptors on neurons in the central nervous system. Although its exact mode of action has not been established, the ability of pimozide to suppress motor and phonic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4297396" conceptname="Tic">tics</span> in Tourette's Disorder is thought to be a function of its dopaminergic blocking activity. However, receptor blockade is often accompanied by a series of secondary alterations in central dopamine metabolism and function which may contribute to both pimozide's therapeutic and untoward effects. In addition, pimozide, in common with other antipsychotic drugs, has various effects on other central nervous system receptor systems which are not fully characterized.</p>

<h2>Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics</h2>
<p class="First">More than 50% of a dose of pimozide is absorbed after oral administration. Based on the pharmacokinetic and metabolic profile, pimozide appears to undergo significant first pass metabolism. Peak serum levels occur generally six to eight hours (range 4-12 hours) after dosing.</p>
<p>Pimozide is extensively metabolized, primarily by N-dealkylation in the liver. This metabolism is catalyzed mainly by the cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP 3A4) enzymatic system and to a lesser extent, by cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP 1A2) and cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP 2D6). Two major metabolites have been identified, 1-(4-piperidyl)-2-benzimidazolinone and 4,4-bis(4-fluorophenyl) butyric acid. The antipsychotic activity of these metabolites is undetermined. The major route of elimination of pimozide and its metabolites is through the kidney.</p>
<p>The mean serum elimination half-life of pimozide in schizophrenic patients was approximately 55 hours. There was a 13-fold interindividual difference in the area under the serum pimozide level-time curve and an equivalent degree of variation in peak serum levels among patients studied. The significance of this is unclear since there are few correlations between plasma levels and clinical findings.</p>
<p>Effects of food and disease upon the absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination of pimozide are not known. Effects of concomitant medication and genetic variations on pimozide metabolism are described in the <span class="Bold"><a href="#CONTRAINDICATIONS">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a></span> and <span class="Bold"><a href="#PRE">PRECAUTIONS</a></span> sections.</p>

<h1>INDICATIONS AND USAGE</h1>
<p class="First">ORAP (pimozide) is indicated for the suppression of motor and phonic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4297396" conceptname="Tic">tics</span> in patients with Tourette's Disorder who have failed to respond satisfactorily to standard treatment. ORAP is not intended as a treatment of first choice nor is it intended for the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4297396" conceptname="Tic">tics</span> that are merely annoying or cosmetically troublesome. ORAP should be reserved for use in Tourette's Disorder patients whose development and/or daily life function is severely compromised by the presence of motor and phonic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4297396" conceptname="Tic">tics</span>.</p>
<p>Evidence supporting approval of pimozide for use in Tourette's Disorder was obtained in two controlled clinical investigations which enrolled patients between the ages of 8 and 53 years. Most subjects in the two trials were 12 or older.</p>

<h1>CONTRAINDICATIONS</h1>
<dl>
<dt>1.</dt>
<dd>ORAP (pimozide) is contraindicated in the treatment of simple <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4297396" conceptname="Tic">tics</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4297396" conceptname="Tic">tics</span> other than those associated with Tourette's Disorder.</dd>
<dt>2.</dt>
<dd>ORAP should not be used in patients taking drugs that may, themselves, cause motor and phonic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4297396" conceptname="Tic">tics</span> (e.g., pemoline, methylphenidate and amphetamines) until such patients have been withdrawn from these drugs to determine whether or not the drugs, rather than Tourette's Disorder, are responsible for the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4297396" conceptname="Tic">tics</span>.</dd>
<dt>3.</dt>
<dd>Because ORAP prolongs the QT interval of the electrocardiogram it is contraindicated in patients with congenital <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="314664" conceptname="Long QT syndrome">long QT syndrome</span>, patients with a history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">cardiac arrhythmias</span>, patients taking other drugs which prolong the QT interval of the electrocardiogram or patients with known <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437833" conceptname="Hypokalemia">hypokalemia</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4098604" conceptname="Hypomagnesemia">hypomagnesemia</span>  (see also <span class="Bold"><a href="#PreDI">PRECAUTIONS - Drug Interactions</a></span>).</dd>
<dt>4.</dt>
<dd>ORAP is contraindicated in patients with severe toxic central nervous system <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380834" conceptname="Coma">comatose</span> states from any cause.</dd>
<dt>5.</dt>
<dd>ORAP is contraindicated in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity</span> to it. As it is not known whether cross-sensitivity exists among the antipsychotics, pimozide should be used with appropriate caution in patients who have demonstrated <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity</span> to other antipsychotic drugs.</dd>
<dt>6.</dt>
<dd><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4185572" conceptname="Ventricular arrhythmia">Ventricular arrhythmias</span> have been rarely associated with the use of macrolide antibiotics in patients with prolonged QT intervals, as might be produced by ORAP. Specifically, two <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4132309" conceptname="Sudden death">sudden deaths</span> have been reported when clarithromycin was added to ongoing pimozide therapy. Furthermore, some evidence suggests that pimozide is metabolized partly by the enzyme system cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP 3A4). Macrolide antibiotics are inhibitors of CYP 3A4, and thus could potentially impede pimozide metabolism. For these reasons, ORAP is contraindicated in patients receiving the macrolide antibiotics clarithromycin, erythromycin, azithromycin, dirithromycin, and troleandomycin.</dd>
<dt>7.</dt>
<dd>Concomitant use in patients taking Celexa or Lexapro is contraindicated (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#PreDI_PC">Precautions - Drug Interactions - Pimozide and Celexa</a></span>).</dd>
<dt>8.</dt>
<dd>Clinical drug interaction studies have demonstrated that pimozide is also metabolized by CYP 2D6.  Concomitant use of ORAP with paroxetine and other strong CYP 2D6 inhibitors is contraindicated (See <span class="Bold"><a href="#PreDI">PRECAUTIONS – Drug Interactions</a></span>). </dd>
<dt>9.</dt>
<dd>Concomitant use of pimozide in patients taking sertraline is contraindicated (See <span class="Bold"><a href="#PreDI">PRECAUTIONS – Drug Interactions</a></span>). </dd>
</dl>
<p class="First">Because azole antifungal agents are also inhibitors of the CYP 3A4 enzymes and thus may likewise impair pimozide metabolism, ORAP is contraindicated in patients receiving the azole antifungal agents itraconazole and ketoconazole.</p>
<p>Similarly, protease inhibitor drugs are also inhibitors of CYP 3A4, and thus ORAP is contraindicated in patients receiving protease inhibitors such as ritonavir, saquinovir, indinavir, and nelfinavir. (See <span class="Bold"><a href="#PreDI">PRECAUTIONS - Drug Interactions</a></span>.)</p>
<p>Nefazodone is a potent inhibitor of CYP 3A4, and its concomitant use with ORAP is also contraindicated.</p>
<p>Other drugs that are relatively less potent inhibitors of CYP 3A4 should also be avoided, in view of the risks: e.g. zileuton, fluvoxamine. </p>

<h1>WARNINGS</h1>
<p class="First">The use of ORAP (pimozide) in the treatment of Tourette's Disorder involves different risk/benefit considerations than when antipsychotic drugs are used to treat other conditions. Consequently, a decision to use ORAP should take into consideration the following (see also <span class="Bold"><a href="#PreIFP">PRECAUTIONS - Information for Patients</a></span>).</p>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">

<h2><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">Tardive Dyskinesia</span></h2>
<p class="First">A syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs. Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic treatment, which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">tardive dyskinesia</span> is unknown.</p>
<p>Both the risk of developing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">tardive dyskinesia</span> and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient increase. However, the syndrome can develop, although much less commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses.</p>
<p>There is no known treatment for established cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">tardive dyskinesia</span>, although the syndrome may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is withdrawn. Antipsychotic treatment itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome and thereby may possibly mask the underlying process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of the syndrome is unknown.</p>
<p>Given these considerations, antipsychotic drugs should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">tardive dyskinesia</span>. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients who suffer from a chronic illness that, 1) is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs, and, 2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. The need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically.</p>
<p>If signs and symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">tardive dyskinesia</span> appear in a patient on antipsychotics, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment despite the presence of the syndrome.</p>

<p class="First">A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="379802" conceptname="Neuroleptic malignant syndrome">Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome</span> (NMS) has been reported in association with antipsychotic drugs. Clinical manifestations of NMS are <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4260205" conceptname="Hyperpyrexia">hyperpyrexia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4050941" conceptname="Muscle rigidity">muscle rigidity</span>, altered mental status (including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4085823" conceptname="Catatonia">catatonic</span> signs) and evidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434633" conceptname="Disorder of autonomic nervous system">autonomic instability</span> (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4088122" conceptname="Heart irregular">irregular pulse</span> or blood pressure, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">tachycardia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138565" conceptname="Hyperhidrosis">diaphoresis</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">cardiac dysrhythmias</span>). Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439142" conceptname="Myoglobinuria">myoglobinuria</span> (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4230337" conceptname="Rhabdomyolysis">rhabdomyolysis</span>) and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="197320" conceptname="Acute renal failure syndrome">acute renal failure</span>.</p>
<p>The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to identify cases where the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="255848" conceptname="Pneumonia">pneumonia</span>, systemic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span>, etc.) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4181404" conceptname="Heat stroke">heat stroke</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">drug fever</span> and primary central nervous system (CNS) pathology.</p>
<p>The management of NMS should include 1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy, 2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring, and 3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for uncomplicated NMS.</p>
<p>If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. The patient should be carefully monitored, since recurrences of NMS have been reported.</p>

<h2>Other</h2>
<p class="First">Sudden, unexpected <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> have occurred in experimental studies of conditions other than Tourette's Disorder. These <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> occurred while patients were receiving dosages in the range of 1 mg per kg. One possible mechanism for such <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> is prolongation of the QT interval predisposing patients to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4185572" conceptname="Ventricular arrhythmia">ventricular arrhythmia</span>. An electrocardiogram should be performed before ORAP treatment is initiated and periodically thereafter, especially during the period of dose adjustment.</p>
<p>ORAP may have a tumorigenic potential. Based on studies conducted in mice, it is known that pimozide can produce a dose-related increase in pituitary tumors. The full significance of this finding is not known, but should be taken into consideration in the physician's and patient's decisions to use this drug product. This finding should be given special consideration when the patient is young and chronic use of pimozide is anticipated (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#PreCMIF">PRECAUTIONS - Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</a></span>).</p>

<h2>General</h2>
<p class="First">ORAP (pimozide) may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks, such as driving a car or operating machinery, especially during the first few days of therapy.</p>
<p>ORAP produces anticholinergic side effects and should be used with caution in individuals whose conditions may be aggravated by anticholinergic activity.</p>
<p>ORAP should be administered cautiously to patients with impairment of liver or kidney function, because it is metabolized by the liver and excreted by the kidneys.</p>
<p>Antipsychotics should be administered with caution to patients receiving anticonvulsant medication, with a history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span>, or with EEG abnormalities, because they may lower the convulsive threshold.

<a name="PreIFP"></a><a name="section-6.3"></a><p></p>
<h2>Information for Patients</h2>
<p class="First">Treatment with ORAP exposes the patient to serious risks. A decision to use ORAP chronically in Tourette's Disorder is one that deserves full consideration by the patient (or patient's family) as well as by the treating physician. Because the goal of treatment is symptomatic improvement, the patient's view of the need for treatment and assessment of response are critical in evaluating the impact of therapy and weighing its benefits against the risks. Since the physician is the primary source of information about the use of a drug in any disease, it is recommended that the following information be discussed with patients and/or their families.</p>
<p>ORAP is intended only for use in patients with Tourette's Disorder whose symptoms are severe and who cannot tolerate, or who do not respond to HALDOL<span class="Sup">®</span> (haloperidol).</p>
<p>Given the likelihood that a proportion of patients exposed chronically to antipsychotics will develop <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">tardive dyskinesia</span>, it is advised that all patients in whom chronic use is contemplated be given, if possible, full information about this risk. The decision to inform patients and/or their guardians must obviously take into account the clinical circumstances and the competency of the patient to understand the information provided.</p>
<p>There is limited information available on the use of ORAP in children under 12 years of age.</p>
<p>The information available on ORAP from foreign marketing experience and from U.S. clinical trials indicates that ORAP has a side effect profile similar to that of other antipsychotic drugs. Patients should be informed that all types of side effects associated with the use of antipsychotics may be associated with the use of ORAP.</p>
<p>In addition, sudden, unexpected <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> have occurred in patients taking high doses of ORAP for conditions other than Tourette's Disorder. These <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> may have been the result of an effect of ORAP upon the heart. Therefore, patients should be instructed not to exceed the prescribed dose of ORAP and they should realize the need for the initial ECG and for follow-up ECGs during treatment.</p>
<p>Also, pimozide, at a dose about 15 times that given humans, caused an increase in the number of benign tumors of the pituitary gland in female mice. It is not possible to say how important this is. Similar tumors were not seen in rats given pimozide, nor at lower doses in mice, which is reassuring. However, any such finding must be considered to suggest a possible risk of long term use of the drug.</p>
<p>Because substances in grapefruit juice may inhibit the metabolism of pimozide by CYP 3A4, patients should be advised to avoid grapefruit juice.</p>

<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34075-2">
<a name="PreLT"></a><a name="section-6.4"></a><p></p>
<h2>Laboratory Tests</h2>
<p class="First">An ECG should be done at baseline and periodically thereafter throughout the period of dose adjustment. Any indication of prolongation of QTc interval beyond an absolute limit of 0.47 seconds (children) or 0.52 seconds (adults), or more than 25% above the patient's original baseline should be considered a basis for stopping further dose increase (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#CONTRAINDICATIONS">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a></span>) and considering a lower dose.</p>

<h2>Drug Interactions</h2>
<p class="First">Because ORAP prolongs the QT interval of the electrocardiogram, an additive effect on QT interval would be anticipated if administered with other drugs, such as phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants or antiarrhythmic agents, which prolong the QT interval. Accordingly, pimozide should not be given with dofetilide, sotalol, quinidine, other Class Ia and III anti-arrhythmics, mesoridazine, thioridazine, chlorpromazine, droperidol, sparfloxacin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, halofantrine, mefloquine, pentamidine, arsenic trioxide, levomethadyl acetate, dolasetron mesylate, probucol, tacrolimus, ziprasidone, or other drugs that have demonstrated QT prolongation as one of their pharmacodynamic effects. Also, the use of macrolide antibiotics in patients with prolonged QT intervals has been rarely associated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4185572" conceptname="Ventricular arrhythmia">ventricular arrhythmias</span>. Such concomitant administration should not be undertaken (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#CONTRAINDICATIONS">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a></span>).</p>
<p>Since ORAP is partly metabolized via CYP 3A4, it should not be administered concomitantly with inhibitors of this metabolic system, such as azole antifungal agents and protease inhibitor drugs (see <a href="#CONTRAINDICATIONS">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a>).</p>

<h3><span class="Bold">Pimozide and Celexa</span></h3>
<p class="First">In a controlled study, a single dose of pimozide 2 mg co-administered with racemic citalopram 40 mg given once daily for 11 days was associated with a mean increase in QTc values of approximately 10 msec compared to pimozide given alone. Racemic citalopram did not alter the mean AUC or C<span class="Sub">max</span> of pimozide. The mechanism of this <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196500" conceptname="Drug interaction">pharmacodynamic interaction</span> is not known. Concomitant use of pimozide and Celexa or Lexapro is contraindicated (See <span class="Bold"><a href="#CONTRAINDICATIONS">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a></span>).</p>
<p>CYP 2D6 inhibitors: In healthy subjects, co-administration of pimozide 2 mg (single dose) and paroxetine 60 mg resulted in a 151% increase in pimozide AUC and a 62% increase in pimozide Cmax compared to pimozide administered alone. The increase in pimozide AUC and Cmax is related to the CYP 2D6 inhibitory properties of paroxetine. Concomitant use of pimozide and paroxetine or other strong CYP 2D6 inhibitors are contraindicated (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#CONTRAINDICATIONS">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a></span>).</p>
<p>As CYP 1A2 may also contribute to the metabolism of ORAP, prescribers should be aware of the theoretical potential for drug interactions with inhibitors of this enzymatic system.</p>
<p>ORAP may be capable of potentiating CNS depressants, including analgesics, sedatives, anxiolytics, and alcohol.</p>

<h2>Pharmacogenomics</h2>
<p class="First">Individuals with genetic variations resulting in poor CYP 2D6 metabolism (approximately 5 to 10% of the population) exhibit higher pimozide concentrations than extensive CYP 2D6 metabolizers. The concentrations observed in poor CYP 2D6 metabolizers are similar to those seen with strong CYP 2D6 inhibitors such as paroxetine. The time to achieve steady state pimozide concentrations is expected to be longer (approximately 2 weeks) in poor CYP 2D6 metabolizers because of the prolonged half-life. Alternative dosing strategies are recommended in patients who are genetically poor CYP 2D6 metabolizers (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#DA">DOSAGE and ADMINISTRATION</a></span>).</p>

<h2>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h2>
<p class="First">Carcinogenicity studies were conducted in mice and rats. In mice, pimozide causes a dose-related increase in pituitary and mammary tumors.</p>
<p>When mice were treated for up to 18 months with pimozide, pituitary gland changes developed in females only. These changes were characterized as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4296894" conceptname="Hyperplasia">hyperplasia</span> at doses approximating the human dose and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106411" conceptname="Adenofibroma">adenoma</span> at doses about fifteen times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg per kg basis. The mechanism for the induction of pituitary tumors in mice is not known.</p>
<p>Mammary gland tumors in female mice were also increased, but these tumors are expected in rodents treated with antipsychotic drugs which elevate prolactin levels. Chronic administration of an antipsychotic also causes elevated prolactin levels in humans. Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately one-third of human breast cancers are prolactin-dependent <span class="Italics">in vitro</span>, a factor of potential importance if the prescription of these drugs is contemplated in a patient with a previously detected breast cancer. Although disturbances such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79884" conceptname="Galactorrhea not associated with childbirth">galactorrhea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443800" conceptname="Amenorrhea">amenorrhea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168447" conceptname="Gynecomastia">gynecomastia</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4216771" conceptname="Impotence">impotence</span> have been reported with antipsychotic drugs, the clinical significance of elevated serum prolactin levels is unknown for most patients. Neither clinical studies nor epidemiologic studies conducted to date have shown an association between chronic administration of these drugs and mammary tumorigenesis. The available evidence, however, is considered too limited to be conclusive at this time.</p>
<p>In a 24-month carcinogenicity study in rats, animals received up to 50 times the maximum recommended human dose. No increased incidence of overall tumors or tumors at any site was observed in either sex. Because of the limited number of animals surviving this study, the meaning of these results is unclear.</p>
<p>Pimozide did not have mutagenic activity in the Ames test with four bacterial test <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strains</span>, in the mouse dominant lethal test or in the micronucleus test in rats.</p>
<p>Reproduction studies in animals were not adequate to assess all aspects of fertility. Nevertheless, female rats administered pimozide had prolonged estrus cycles, an effect also produced by other antipsychotic drugs.</p>

<p class="First">Reproduction studies performed in rats and rabbits at oral doses up to 8 times the maximum human dose did not reveal evidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4240324" conceptname="Teratogenesis">teratogenicity</span>. In the rat, however, this multiple of the human dose resulted in decreased pregnancies and in the retarded development of fetuses.

In the rabbit, maternal toxicity, mortality, decreased <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134784" conceptname="Weight increased">weight gain</span>, and embryotoxicity including increased resorptions were dose-related. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, pimozide should be given to a pregnant woman only if the potential benefits of treatment clearly outweigh the potential risks.</p>

<h2>Nursing Mothers</h2>
<p class="First">It is not known whether pimozide is excreted in human milk.

<h2>Pediatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">Although Tourette's Disorder most often has its onset between the ages of 2 and 15 years, information on the use and efficacy of ORAP in patients less than 12 years of age is limited. A 24-week open label study in 36 children between the ages of 2 and 12 demonstrated that pimozide has a similar safety profile in this age group as in older patients and there were no safety findings that would preclude its use in this age group.</p>
<p>Because its use and safety have not been evaluated in other childhood disorders, ORAP is not recommended for use in any condition other than Tourette's Disorder.</p>

<h3><span class="Bold">Extrapyramidal Reactions</span></h3>
<p class="First">Neuromuscular (extrapyramidal) reactions during the administration of ORAP<span class="Sup">®</span> (pimozide) have been reported frequently, often during the first few days of treatment. In most patients, these reactions involved Parkinson-like symptoms which, when first observed, were usually mild to moderately severe and usually reversible.</p>

Generally the occurrence and severity of most <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373747" conceptname="Extrapyramidal disease">extrapyramidal symptoms</span> are dose-related since they occur at relatively high doses and have been shown to disappear or become less severe when the dose is reduced. Administration of antiparkinson drugs such as benztropine mesylate or trihexyphenidyl hydrochloride may be required for control of such reactions. It should be noted that persistent extrapyramidal reactions have been reported and that the drug may have to be discontinued in such cases.</p>

<h3><span class="Bold">Withdrawal Emergent Neurological Signs</span></h3>
<p class="First">Generally, patients receiving short term therapy experience no problems with abrupt discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs. However, some patients on maintenance treatment experience transient dyskinetic signs after abrupt withdrawal. In certain of these cases the dyskinetic movements are indistinguishable from the syndrome described below under "<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">Tardive Dyskinesia</span>" except for duration. It is not known whether gradual withdrawal of antipsychotic drugs will reduce the rate of occurrence of withdrawal emergent neurological signs, but until further evidence becomes available, it seems reasonable to gradually withdraw use of ORAP.</p>

The risk appears to be greater in elderly patients on high-dose therapy, especially females. The symptoms are persistent and in some patients appear irreversible. The syndrome is characterized by rhythmical involuntary movements of tongue, face, mouth or jaw (e.g., protrusion of tongue, puffing of cheeks, puckering of mouth, chewing movements). Sometimes these may be accompanied by involuntary movements of extremities and the trunk.</p>
<p>There is no known effective treatment for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010823" conceptname="Tardive dyskinesia">tardive dyskinesia</span>; antiparkinson agents usually do not alleviate the symptoms of this syndrome.

<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<p class="First">In general, the signs and symptoms of overdosage with ORAP (pimozide) would be an exaggeration of known pharmacologic effects and adverse reactions, the most prominent of which would be:  1) electrocardiographic abnormalities, 2) severe extrapyramidal reactions, 3) <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, 4) a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380834" conceptname="Coma">comatose</span> state with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>.</p>
<p>In the event of overdosage, gastric lavage, establishment of a patent airway and, if necessary, mechanically-assisted respiration are advised. Electrocardiographic monitoring should commence immediately and continue until the ECG parameters are within the normal range. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">Hypotension</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201965" conceptname="Shock">circulatory collapse</span> may be counteracted by use of intravenous fluids, plasma, or concentrated albumin, and vasopressor agents such as metaraminol, phenylephrine and norepinephrine.</p>
<p>Epinephrine should not be used. In case of severe extrapyramidal reactions, antiparkinson medication should be administered. Because of the long half-life of pimozide, patients who take an <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> should be observed for at least 4 days. As with all drugs, the physician should consider contacting a poison control center for additional information on the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="ID_9ab662dc-5029-48cf-b5ed-cd729d6eb786"></a><a name="section-9.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>General</h2>
<p class="First">The suppression of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4297396" conceptname="Tic">tics</span> by ORAP requires a slow and gradual introduction of the drug. The patient's dose should be carefully adjusted to a point where the suppression of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4297396" conceptname="Tic">tics</span> and the relief afforded is balanced against the untoward side effects of the drug.</p>
<p>An ECG should be done at baseline and periodically thereafter, especially during the period of dose adjustment (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#Warnings">WARNINGS</a></span> and <span class="Bold"><a href="#PreLT">PRECAUTIONS - Laboratory Tests</a></span>). Periodic attempts should be made to reduce the dosage of ORAP to see whether or not <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4297396" conceptname="Tic">tics</span> persist at the level and extent first identified. In attempts to reduce the dosage of ORAP, consideration should be given to the possibility that increases of tic intensity and frequency may represent a transient, withdrawal-related phenomenon rather than a return of disease symptoms. Specifically, one to two weeks should be allowed to elapse before one concludes that an increase in tic manifestations is a function of the underlying disease syndrome rather than a response to drug withdrawal. A gradual withdrawal is recommended in any case.</p>

<h2>Children</h2>
<p class="First">Reliable dose response data for the effects of ORAP (pimozide) on tic manifestation in Tourette's Disorder patients below the age of twelve are not available.</p>
<p>Treatment should be initiated at a dose of 0.05 mg/kg preferably taken once at bedtime. The dose may be increased every third day to a maximum of 0.2 mg/kg not to exceed 10 mg/day.</p>
<p>At doses above 0.05 mg/kg/day, CYP 2D6 genotyping should be performed. In poor CYP 2D6 metabolizers, ORAP doses should not exceed 0.05 mg/kg/day, and doses should not be increased earlier than 14 days (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#Pharmacogenomics">PRECAUTIONS – Pharmacogenomics</a></span>).</p>

<h2>Adults</h2>
<p class="First">In general, treatment with ORAP should be initiated with a dose of 1 to 2 mg a day in divided doses. The dose may be increased thereafter every other day. Most patients are maintained at less than 0.2 mg/kg/day, or 10 mg/day, whichever is less. Doses greater than 0.2 mg/kg/day or 10 mg/day are not recommended.</p>
<p>At doses above 4 mg/day, CYP 2D6 genotyping should be performed. In poor CYP 2D6 metabolizers, ORAP doses should not exceed 4 mg/day, and doses should not be increased earlier than 14 days (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#Pharmacogenomics">PRECAUTIONS – Pharmacogenomics</a></span>).</p>
