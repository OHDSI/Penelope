<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pharmacodynamics</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">A.  <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198803" conceptname="Benign prostatic hyperplasia">Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia</span> (BPH)</span></p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198803" conceptname="Benign prostatic hyperplasia">Benign prostatic hyperplasia</span> (BPH) is a common cause of urinary outflow obstruction in aging males. Severe BPH may lead to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192450" conceptname="Retention of urine">urinary retention</span> and renal damage. A static and a dynamic component contribute to the symptoms and reduced urinary flow rate associated with BPH.  The static component is related to an increase in prostate size caused, in part, by a proliferation of smooth muscle cells in the prostatic stroma. However, the severity of BPH symptoms and the degree of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4318847" conceptname="Obstruction of urethra">urethral obstruction</span> do not correlate well with the size of the prostate. The dynamic component of BPH is associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the prostate and bladder neck. The degree of tone in this area is mediated by the alpha1 adrenoceptor, which is present in high density in the prostatic stroma, prostatic capsule and bladder neck. Blockade of the alpha1 receptor decreases urethral resistance and may relieve the obstruction and BPH symptoms. In the human prostate, doxazosin mesylate antagonizes phenylephrine (alpha<span class="Sub">1</span> agonist)-induced contractions, <span class="Italics">in vitro</span>, and binds with high affinity to the alpha<span class="Sub">1c</span> adrenoceptor. The receptor subtype is thought to be the predominant functional type in the prostate. Doxazosin mesylate acts within 1-2 weeks to decrease the severity of BPH symptoms and improve urinary flow rate. Since alpha<span class="Sub">1</span> adrenoceptors are of low density in the urinary bladder (apart from the bladder neck), doxazosin mesylate should maintain bladder contractility.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The efficacy of doxazosin mesylate was evaluated extensively in over 900 patients with BPH in double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. Doxazosin mesylate treatment was superior to placebo in improving patient symptoms and urinary flow rate. Significant relief with doxazosin mesylate was seen as early as one week into the treatment regimen, with doxazosin mesylate treated patients (N=173) showing a significant (p&lt;0.01) increase in maximum flow rate of 0.8 mL/sec compared to a decrease of 0.5 mL/sec in the placebo group (N=41). In long-term studies improvement was maintained for up to 2 years of treatment. In 66-71% of patients, improvements above baseline were seen in both symptoms and maximum urinary flow rate.  </p>
<p>In three placebo-controlled studies of 14-16 weeks duration obstructive symptoms (hesitation, intermittency, dribbling, weak urinary stream, incomplete emptying of the bladder) and irritative symptoms (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="40304526" conceptname="Nocturia">nocturia</span>, daytime frequency, urgency, burning) of BPH were evaluated at each visit by patient-assessed symptom questionnaires.  The bothersomeness of symptoms was measured with a modified Boyarsky questionnaire.  Symptom severity/frequency was assessed using a modified Boyarsky questionnaire or an AUA-based questionnaire.  Uroflowmetric evaluations were performed at times of peak (2-6 hours post-dose) and/or trough (24 hours post-dose) plasma concentrations of doxazosin mesylate.</p>
<p>The results from the three placebo-controlled studies (N=609) showing significant efficacy with 4 mg and 8 mg doxazosin are summarized in Table 1. In all three studies, doxazosin mesylate resulted in statistically significant relief of obstructive and irritative symptoms compared to placebo. Statistically significant improvements of 2.3-3.3 mL/sec in maximum flow rate were seen with doxazosin mesylate in Studies 1 and 2, compared to 0.1-0.7 mL/sec with placebo.</p>

</div>
<p>In one fixed dose study (Study 2) doxazosin mesylate therapy (4-8 mg, once daily) resulted in a significant and sustained improvement in maximum urinary flow rate of 2.3-3.3 mL/sec (Table 1) compared to placebo (0.1 mL/sec). In this study, the only study in which weekly evaluations were made, significant improvement with doxazosin mesylate vs. placebo was seen after one week. The proportion of patients who responded with a maximum flow rate improvement of ≥ 3 mL/sec was significantly larger with doxazosin mesylate (34-42%) than placebo (13-17%). A significantly greater improvement was also seen in average flow rate with doxazosin mesylate (1.6 mL/sec) than with placebo (0.2 mL/sec). The onset and time course of symptom relief and increased urinary flow from Study 1 are illustrated in Figure 1.</p>

<p>In BPH patients (N=450) treated for up to 2 years in open-label studies, doxazosin mesylate therapy resulted in significant improvement above baseline in urinary flow rates and BPH symptoms. The significant effects of doxazosin mesylate were maintained over the entire treatment period.</p>
<p>Although blockade of alpha1 adrenoceptors also lowers blood pressure in hypertensive patients with increased peripheral <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4089490" conceptname="Vascular resistance">vascular resistance</span>, doxazosin mesylate treatment of normotensive men with BPH did not result in a clinically significant blood pressure lowering effect (Table 2). The proportion of normotensive patients with a sitting systolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure less than 60 mmHg at any time during treatment with doxazosin mesylate 1-8 mg once daily was 6.7% with doxazosin and not significantly different (statistically) from that with placebo (5%).</p>

<p>The mechanism of action of doxazosin mesylate is selective blockade of the alpha<span class="Sub">1</span> (postjunctional) subtype of adrenergic receptors. Studies in normal human subjects have shown that doxazosin competitively antagonized the pressor effects of phenylephrine (an alpha1 agonist) and the systolic pressor effect of norepinephrine. Doxazosin and prazosin have similar abilities to antagonize phenylephrine. The antihypertensive effect of doxazosin mesylate results from a decrease in systemic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4089490" conceptname="Vascular resistance">vascular resistance</span>. The parent compound doxazosin is primarily responsible for the antihypertensive activity. The low plasma concentrations of known active and inactive metabolites of doxazosin (2-piperazinyl, 6'- and 7'-hydroxy and 6- and 7-O-desmethyl compounds) compared to parent drug indicate that the contribution of even the most potent compound (6'-hydroxy) to the antihypertensive effect of doxazosin in man is probably small. The 6'- and 7'-hydroxy metabolites have demonstrated antioxidant properties at concentrations of 5 µM, <span class="Italics">in vitro</span>.</p>
<p>Administration of doxazosin mesylate results in a reduction in systemic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4089490" conceptname="Vascular resistance">vascular resistance</span>. In patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> there is little change in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4221102" conceptname="Cardiac output">cardiac output</span>. Maximum reductions in blood pressure usually occur 2-6 hours after dosing and are associated with a small increase in standing heart rate. Like other alpha<span class="Sub">1</span>-adrenergic blocking agents, doxazosin has a greater effect on blood pressure and heart rate in the standing position.</p>
<p>In a pooled analysis of placebo-controlled <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> studies with about 300 hypertensive patients per treatment group, doxazosin, at doses of 1-16 mg given once daily, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="314171" conceptname="Low blood pressure reading">lowered blood pressure</span> at 24 hours by about 10/8 mmHg compared to placebo in the standing position and about 9/5 mmHg in the supine position. Peak blood pressure effects (1-6 hours) were larger by about 50-75% (i.e., trough values were about 55-70% of peak effect), with the larger peak-trough differences seen in systolic pressures. There was no apparent difference in the blood pressure response of Caucasians and blacks or of patients above and below age 65. In these predominantly normocholesterolemic patients doxazosin produced small reductions in total serum <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> (2-3%), LDL <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> (4%), and a similarly small increase in HDL/total <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> ratio (4%). The clinical significance of these findings is uncertain. In the same patient population, patients receiving doxazosin mesylate gained a mean of 0.6 kg compared to a mean loss of 0.1 kg for placebo patients.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetics</span></p>
<p>After oral administration of therapeutic doses, peak plasma levels of doxazosin mesylate occur at about 2-3 hours. Bioavailability is approximately 65%, reflecting first pass metabolism of doxazosin by the liver. The effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of doxazosin mesylate was examined in a crossover study with twelve hypertensive subjects. Reductions of 18% in mean maximum plasma concentration and 12% in the area under the concentration-time curve occurred when doxazosin mesylate was administered with food. Neither of these differences was statistically or clinically significant.</p>
<p>Doxazosin mesylate is extensively metabolized in the liver, mainly by O-demethylation of the quinazoline nucleus or hydroxylation of the benzodioxan moiety. Although several active metabolites of doxazosin have been identified, the pharmacokinetics of these metabolites have not been characterized. In a study of two subjects administered radiolabelled doxazosin 2 mg orally and 1 mg intravenously on two separate occasions, approximately 63% of the dose was eliminated in the feces and 9% of the dose was found in the urine. On average only 4.8% of the dose was excreted as unchanged drug in the feces and only a trace of the total radioactivity in the urine was attributed to unchanged drug. At the plasma concentrations achieved by therapeutic doses approximately 98% of the circulating drug is bound to plasma proteins.</p>
<p>Plasma elimination of doxazosin is biphasic, with a terminal elimination half-life of about 22 hours. Steady-state studies in hypertensive patients given doxazosin doses of 2-16 mg once daily showed linear kinetics and dose proportionality. In two studies, following the administration of 2 mg orally once daily, the mean accumulation ratios (steady-state AUC vs. first dose AUC) were 1.2 and 1.7. Enterohepatic recycling is suggested by secondary peaking of plasma doxazosin concentrations.</p>
<p>In a crossover study in 24 normotensive subjects, the pharmacokinetics and safety of doxazosin were shown to be similar with morning and evening dosing regimens. The area under the curve after morning dosing was, however, 11% less than that after evening dosing and the time to peak concentration after evening dosing occurred significantly later than that after morning dosing (5.6 hr vs. 3.5 hr).</p>
<p>The pharmacokinetics of doxazosin mesylate in young (&lt;65 years) and elderly (≥ 65 years) subjects were similar for plasma half-life values and oral clearance. Pharmacokinetic studies in elderly patients and patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> have shown no significant alterations compared to younger patients with normal renal function. Administration of a single 2 mg dose to patients with cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A) showed a 40% increase in exposure to doxazosin. There are only limited data on the effects of drugs known to influence the hepatic metabolism of doxazosin [e.g., cimetidine (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions)]. As with any drug wholly metabolized by the liver, use of doxazosin mesylate in patients with altered liver function should be undertaken with caution.</p>
<p>In two placebo-controlled studies, of normotensive and hypertensive BPH patients, in which doxazosin was administered in the morning and the titration interval was two weeks and one week, respectively, trough plasma concentrations of doxazosin mesylate were similar in the two populations. Linear kinetics and dose proportionality were observed.</p>

<p>These symptoms were common in clinical trials in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>, occurring in up to 23% of all patients treated and causing discontinuation of therapy in about 2%.</p>
<p>In placebo-controlled titration trials in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>, orthostatic effects were minimized by beginning therapy at 1 mg per day and titrating every two weeks to 2, 4, or 8 mg per day. There was an increased frequency of orthostatic effects in patients given 8 mg or more, 10%, compared to 5% at 1-4 mg and 3% in the placebo group.</p>

<h2>Information for Patients (See <span class="Italics">patient package insert</span>):</h2>
<p class="First">Patients should be made aware of the possibility of syncopal and orthostatic symptoms, especially at the initiation of therapy, and urged to avoid driving or hazardous tasks for 24 hours after the first dose, after a dosage increase, and after interruption of therapy when treatment is resumed. They should be cautioned to avoid situations where injury could result should <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135360" conceptname="Syncope">syncope</span> occur during initiation of doxazosin therapy. They should also be advised of the need to sit or lie down when symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="314171" conceptname="Low blood pressure reading">lowered blood pressure</span> occur, although these symptoms are not always orthostatic, and to be careful when rising from a sitting or lying position.

<h2>Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions:</h2>
<p class="First">Doxazosin mesylate does not affect the plasma concentration of prostate specific antigen in patients treated for up to 3 years. Both doxazosin, an alpha<span class="Sub">1</span> inhibitor, and finasteride, a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor, are highly protein bound and hepatically metabolized. There is no definitive controlled clinical experience on the concomitant use of alpha1 inhibitors and 5-alpha reductase inhibitors at this time.</p>

<p class="First">Analysis of hematologic data from hypertensive patients receiving doxazosin mesylate in controlled <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> clinical trials showed that the mean WBC (N=474) and mean neutrophil counts (N=419) were decreased by 2.4% and 1.0%, respectively, compared to placebo, a phenomenon seen with other alpha blocking drugs. In BPH patients the incidence of clinically significant WBC abnormalities was 0.4% (2/459) with doxazosin mesylate and 0% (0/147) with placebo, with no statistically significant difference between the two treatment groups. A search through a data base of 2400 hypertensive patients and 665 BPH patients revealed 4 hypertensives in which drug-related <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="320073" conceptname="Neutropenia">neutropenia</span> could not be ruled out and one BPH patient in which drug related <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435224" conceptname="Leukopenia">leukopenia</span> could not be ruled out. Two hypertensives had a single low value on the last day of treatment. Two hypertensives had stable, non-progressive neutrophil counts in the 1000/mm3 range over periods of 20 and 40 weeks. One BPH patient had a decrease from a WBC count of 4800/mm3 to 2700/mm3 at the end of the study; there was no evidence of clinical impairment. In cases where follow-up was available the WBCs and neutrophil counts returned to normal after discontinuation of doxazosin mesylate. No patients became symptomatic as a result of the low WBC or neutrophil counts.</p>

<h2>Drug Interactions:</h2>
<p class="First">Most (98%) of plasma doxazosin is protein bound. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> data in human plasma indicate that doxazosin mesylate has no effect on protein binding of digoxin, warfarin, phenytoin or indomethacin. There is no information on the effect of other highly plasma protein bound drugs on doxazosin binding. Doxazosin mesylate has been administered without any evidence of an adverse drug interaction to patients receiving thiazide diuretics, beta-blocking agents, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. In a placebo-controlled trial in normal volunteers, the administration of a single 1 mg dose of doxazosin on day 1 of a four-day regimen of oral cimetidine (400 mg twice daily) resulted in a 10% increase in mean AUC of doxazosin (p=0.006), and a slight but not statistically significant increase in mean Cmax and mean half-life of doxazosin. The clinical significance of this increase in doxazosin AUC is unknown.</p>
<p>In clinical trials, doxazosin mesylate have been administered to patients on a variety of concomitant medications; while no formal interaction studies have been conducted, no interactions were observed. Doxazosin mesylate tablets have been used with the following drugs or drug classes: 1) analgesic/anti-inflammatory (e.g., acetaminophen, aspirin, codeine and codeine combinations, ibuprofen, indomethacin); 2) antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin); 3) antihistamines (e.g., chlorpheniramine); 4) cardiovascular agents (e.g., atenolol, hydrochlorothiazide, propranolol); 5) corticosteroids; 6) gastrointestinal agents (e.g., antacids); 7) hypoglycemics and endocrine drugs; 8) sedatives and tranquilizers (e.g., diazepam); 9) <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="260427" conceptname="Common cold">cold</span> and flu remedies.</p>
<p>Concomitant administration of dosazosin mesylate with a phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitor can result in additive blood pressure lowering effects and symptomatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> (see <a href="#ID_ed02def2-2d48-4bd7-99e1-3506aa4cdeca">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>).</p>

Myocardial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012171" conceptname="Fibrosis">fibrosis</span> was observed in both rats and mice treated in the same manner with 40 mg doxazosin/kg/day for 18 months (exposure 8 times human AUC exposure in rats and somewhat equivalent to human C<span class="Sub">max</span> exposure in mice). No cardiotoxicity was observed at lower doses (up to 10 or 20 mg/kg/day, depending on the study) in either species. These lesions were not observed after 12 months of oral dosing in dogs at maximum doses of 20 mg/kg/day [maximum plasma concentrations (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) in dogs 14 times the C<span class="Sub">max</span> exposure in humans receiving a 12 mg/day therapeutic dose] and in Wistar rats at doses of 100 mg/kg/day (C<span class="Sub">max</span> exposures 15 times human C<span class="Sub">max</span> exposure with a 12 mg/day therapeutic dose). There is no evidence that similar lesions occur in humans.</p>

<h2>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility:</h2>
<p class="First">Chronic dietary administration (up to 24 months) of doxazosin mesylate at maximally tolerated doses of 40 mg/kg/day in rats and 120 mg/kg/day in mice revealed no evidence of carcinogenic potential. The highest doses evaluated in the rat and mouse studies are associated with AUCs (a measure of systemic exposure) that are 8 times and 4 times, respectively, the human AUC at a dose of 16 mg/day.</p>
<p>Mutagenicity studies revealed no drug- or metabolite-related effects at either chromosomal or subchromosomal levels.</p>
<p>Studies in rats showed reduced fertility in males treated with doxazosin at oral doses of 20 (but not 5 or 10) mg/kg/day, about 4 times the AUC exposures obtained with a 12 mg/day human dose. This effect was reversible within two weeks of drug withdrawal. There have been no reports of any effects of doxazosin on male fertility in humans.</p>

<h2>Pregnancy:</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Teratogenic</span><span class="Bold"> Effects, Pregnancy Category C</span>. Studies in pregnant rabbits and rats at daily oral doses of up to 41 and 20 mg/kg, respectively (plasma drug concentrations 10 and 4 times human C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC exposures with a 12 mg/day therapeutic dose), have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus. A dosage regimen of 82 mg/kg/day in the rabbit was associated with reduced fetal survival. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, doxazosin mesylate should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.</p>
<p>Radioactivity was found to cross the placenta following oral administration of labelled doxazosin to pregnant rats.</p>

<h2>Nonteratogenic Effects:</h2>
<p class="First">In peri-postnatal studies in rats, postnatal development at maternal doses of 40 or 50 mg/kg/day of doxazosin (8 times human AUC exposure with a 12 mg/day therapeutic dose) was delayed as evidenced by slower body <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134784" conceptname="Weight increased">weight gain</span> and slightly later appearance of anatomical features and reflexes.</p>

<h2>Nursing Mothers:</h2>
<p class="First">Studies in lactating rats given a single oral dose of 1 mg/kg of [2-<span class="Sup">14</span>C]-doxazosin mesylate indicate that doxazosin accumulates in rat breast milk with a maximum concentration about 20 times greater than the maternal plasma concentration. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when doxazosin mesylate is administered to a nursing mother.</p>

<p class="First">The safety and effectiveness profile of doxazosin mesylate in BPH was similar in the elderly (age ≥65 years) and younger (age &lt;65 years) patients. </p>
<p>For <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>. Clinical studies of doxazosin mesylate did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.  Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.  In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p>

<p>In these placebo-controlled studies of 665 doxazosin mesylate patients, treated for a mean of 85 days, additional adverse reactions have been reported. These are less than 1% and not distinguishable from those that occurred in the placebo group. Adverse reactions with an incidence of less than 1% but of clinical interest are (doxazosin mesylate vs. placebo): <span class="Italics">Cardiovascular System</span>: <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321318" conceptname="Angina pectoris">angina pectoris</span> (0.6% vs. 0.7%), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319041" conceptname="Orthostatic hypotension">postural hypotension</span> (0.3% vs. 0.3%), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135360" conceptname="Syncope">syncope</span> (0.5% vs. 0.0%), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">tachycardia</span> (0.9% vs. 0.0%); <span class="Italics">Urogenital System</span>: <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="197684" conceptname="Dysuria">dysuria</span> (0.5% vs. 1.3%), and <span class="Italics">Psychiatric Disorders</span>: <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443262" conceptname="Lack or loss of sexual desire">libido decreased</span> (0.8% vs. 0.3%). The safety profile in patients treated for up to three years was similar to that in the placebo-controlled studies.</p>
<p>The majority of adverse experiences with doxazosin mesylate were mild.</p>

<p>Doxazosin mesylate has been administered to approximately 4000 hypertensive patients, of whom 1679 were included in the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> clinical development program. In that program, minor adverse effects were frequent, but led to discontinuation of treatment in only 7% of patients. In placebo-controlled studies adverse effects occurred in 49% and 40% of patients in the doxazosin and placebo groups, respectively, and led to discontinuation in 2% of patients in each group. The major reasons for discontinuation were postural effects (2%), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433595" conceptname="Edema">edema</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4272240" conceptname="Malaise">malaise</span>/<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223659" conceptname="Fatigue">fatigue</span>, and some heart rate disturbance, each about 0.7%.</p>
<p>In controlled <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> clinical trials directly comparing doxazosin mesylate to placebo there was no significant difference in the incidence of side effects, except for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span> (including postural), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134784" conceptname="Weight increased">weight gain</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223659" conceptname="Fatigue">fatigue</span>/<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4272240" conceptname="Malaise">malaise</span>. Postural effects and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433595" conceptname="Edema">edema</span> appeared to be dose related. The prevalence rates presented below are based on combined data from placebo-controlled studies involving once daily administration of doxazosin at doses ranging from 1-16 mg. Table 4 summarizes those adverse experiences (possibly/probably related) reported for patients in these <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> studies where the prevalence rate in the doxazosin group was at least 0.5% or where the reaction is of particular interest.</p>

<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<p class="First">Experience with doxazosin mesylate overdosage is limited. Two adolescents who each intentionally ingested 40 mg doxazosin mesylate with diclofenac or acetaminophen, were treated with gastric lavage with activated charcoal and made full recoveries. A two-year-old child who accidentally ingested 4 mg doxazosin mesylate was treated with gastric lavage and remained normotensive during the five-hour emergency room observation period. A six-month-old child accidentally received a crushed 1 mg tablet of doxazosin mesylate and was reported to have been drowsy.

<p>The oral LD<span class="Sub">50</span> of doxazosin is greater than 1000 mg/kg in mice and rats. The most likely manifestation of overdosage would be <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, for which the usual treatment would be intravenous infusion of fluid. As doxazosin is highly protein bound, dialysis would not be indicated.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">DOSAGE MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED</span>.  The initial dosage of doxazosin mesylate tablets in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> and/or BPH is 1 mg given once daily in the a.m. or p.m. This starting dose is intended to minimize the frequency of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319041" conceptname="Orthostatic hypotension">postural hypotension</span> and first dose <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135360" conceptname="Syncope">syncope</span> associated with doxazosin mesylate tablets. Postural effects are most likely to occur between 2 and 6 hours after a dose. Therefore blood pressure measurements should be taken during this time period after the first dose and with each increase in dose. If doxazosin mesylate tablets administration is discontinued for several days, therapy should be restarted using the initial dosing regimen.</p>
<p>Concomitant administration of doxazosin mesylate with a PDE-5 inhibitor can result in additive blood pressure lowering effects and symptomatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>; therefore, PDE-5 inhibitor therapy should be initiated at the lowest dose in patients taking doxazosin mesylate tablets.</p>

<h1>PATIENT INFORMATION ABOUT<br>DOXAZOSIN MESYLATE</h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">FOR <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198803" conceptname="Benign prostatic hyperplasia">BENIGN PROSTATIC HYPERPLASIA</span> (BPH)</span></p>
<p>Read this leaflet:</p>
<p>• before you start taking Doxazosin Mesylate</p>
<p>• each time you get a new prescription.</p>
<p>You and your doctor should discuss this treatment and your BPH symptoms before you start taking Doxazosin Mesylate and at your regular checkups.  This leaflet does NOT take the place of discussions with your doctor.</p>
<p>Doxazosin Mesylate is used to treat both <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198803" conceptname="Benign prostatic hyperplasia">benign prostatic hyperplasia</span> (BPH) and high blood pressure (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>).  This leaflet describes Doxazosin Mesylate as treatment for BPH (although you may be taking Doxazosin Mesylate for both your BPH and high blood pressure).</p>
<p><span class="Bold">What is BPH?</span></p>
<p>BPH is an enlargement of the prostate gland.  This gland surrounds the tube that drains the urine from the bladder.  The symptoms of BPH can be caused by a tensing of the enlarged muscle in the prostate gland which blocks the passage of urine.  This can lead to such symptoms as:</p>
<p>• a weak or start-and-stop stream when urinating</p>
<p>• a feeling that the bladder is not completely emptied after urination</p>
<p>• a delay or difficulty in the beginning of urination</p>
<p>• a need to urinate often during the day and especially at night</p>
<p>• a feeling that you must urinate immediately.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Treatment Options for BPH</span></p>
<p>The four main treatment options for BPH are:</p>
<p>• If you are not bothered by your symptoms, you and your doctor may decide on a program of “watchful waiting.?  It is not an active treatment like taking medication or surgery but  involves having regular checkups to see if your condition is getting worse or causing problems.</p>
<p>• Treatment with Doxazosin Mesylate or other similar drugs.  Doxazosin Mesylate is the medication your doctor has prescribed for you.  See “What Doxazosin Mesylate Does,? below.</p>
<p>• Treatment with the medication class of 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (e.g., Proscar<span class="Sup">®</span>).  It can cause the prostate to shrink.  It may take 6 months or more for the full benefit of finasteride to be seen.</p>
<p>• Various surgical procedures.  Your doctor can describe these procedures to you.  The best procedure for you depends on your BPH symptoms and medical condition.  </p>
<p><span class="Bold">What Doxazosin</span><span class="Bold">Mesylate Does </span></p>
<p>Doxazosin Mesylate works on a specific type of muscle found in the prostate, causing it to relax.  This in turn decreases the pressure within the prostate, thus improving the flow of urine and your symptoms.</p>
<p>• Doxazosin Mesylate helps relieve the symptoms of BPH (weak stream, start-and-stop stream, a feeling that your bladder is not completely empty, delay in begining of urination, need to urinate often during the day and especially at night, and feeling that you must urinate immediately).  It does not change the size of the prostate.  The prostate may continue to grow; however, a larger prostate is not necessarily related to more symptoms or to worse symptoms. Doxazosin Mesylate can decrease your symptoms and improve urinary flow, without decreasing the size of the prostate.</p>
<p>• If Doxazosin Mesylate is helping you, you should notice an effect within 1 to 2 weeks after you start your medication.  Doxazosin Mesylate has been studied in over 900 patients for up to 2 years and the drug has been shown to continue to work during long-term treatment.  Even though you take Doxazosin Mesylate and it may help you, Doxazosin Mesylate may not prevent the need for surgery in the future. </p>
<p>• Doxazosin Mesylate does not affect PSA levels.  PSA is the abbreviation for Prostate Specific Antigen.  Your doctor may have done a blood test called PSA.  You may want to ask your doctor more about this if you have had a PSA test done.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Other Important Facts</span></p>
<p>• You should see an improvement of your symptoms within 1 to 2 weeks.  In addition to your other regular checkups you will need to continue seeing your doctor regularly to check your progress regarding your BPH and to monitor your blood pressure.</p>
<p>• Doxazosin Mesylate is not a treatment for prostate cancer.  Your doctor has prescribed Doxazosin Mesylate for your BPH and not for prostate cancer; however, a man can have BPH and prostate cancer at the same time.  Doctors usually recommend that men be checked for prostate cancer once a year when they turn 50 (or 40 if a family member has had prostate cancer).  A higher incidence of prostate cancer has been noted in men of African-American descent.  These checks should continue even if you are taking Doxazosin Mesylate.</p>

This is more likely to occur after you’ve taken the first few doses or if you increase your dose, but can occur at any time while you are taking the drug.  It can also occur if you stop taking the drug and then restart treatment.  If you feel very dizzy, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135360" conceptname="Syncope">faint</span> or “light-headed? you should contact your doctor.  Your doctor will discuss with you how often you need to visit and how often your blood pressure should be checked.</p>
<p>Your blood pressure should be checked when you start taking Doxazosin Mesylate even if you do not have high blood pressure (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>).  Your doctor will discuss with you the details of how blood pressure is measured.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Blood Pressure Measurement:</span>  Whatever equipment is used,  it is usual for your blood pressure to be measured in the following way:  measure your blood pressure after lying quietly on your back for five minutes.  Then, after standing for two minutes measure your blood pressure again.  Your doctor will discuss with you what other times during the day your blood pressure should be taken, such as two to six hours after a dose, before bedtime or after waking up in the morning.  Note that moderate to high-intensity exercise can, over a period of time, lower your average blood pressure.  </p>
<p>You can take Doxazosin Mesylate either in the morning or at bedtime and it will be equally effective.  If you take Doxazosin Mesylate at bedtime but need to get up from bed to go to the bathroom, get up slowly and cautiously until you are sure how the medication affects you.  It is important to get up slowly from a chair or bed at any time until you learn how you react to Doxazosin Mesylate.  You should not drive or do any hazardous tasks until you are used to the effects of the medication.  If you begin to feel dizzy, sit or lie down until you feel better.</p>
<p>• You will start with a 1 mg dose of Doxazosin Mesylate once daily.  Then the once daily dose will be increased as your body gets used to the effects of the medication.  Follow your doctor’s instructions about how to take Doxazosin Mesylate.  You must take it every day at the dose prescribed.  Talk with your doctor if you don’t take it for a few days for some reason;  you may then need to restart the medication at a 1 mg dose, increase your dose gradually and again be cautious about possible <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>.  Do not share Doxazosin Mesylate with anyone else; it was prescribed only for you.</p>
<p>• Other side effects you could have while taking Doxazosin Mesylate, in addition to lowering of the blood pressure, include <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223659" conceptname="Fatigue">fatigue</span> (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223659" conceptname="Fatigue">tiredness</span>), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4275722" conceptname="Swelling">swelling</span> of the feet and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312437" conceptname="Dyspnea">shortness of breath</span>.  Most side effects are mild.  However, you should discuss any unexpected effects you notice with your doctor.</p>
<p>• <span class="Bold">WARNING:</span>  Extremely rarely, Doxazosin Mesylate and similar medications have caused <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4213599" conceptname="Painful penile erection">painful erection</span> of the penis, sustained for hours and unrelieved by sexual intercourse or masturbation.  This condition is serious, and if untreated it can be followed by permanent inability to have an erection.  If you have a prolonged abnormal erection, call your doctor or go to an emergency room as soon as possible.</p>
<p>• Tell your surgeon if you take or have taken Doxazosin Mesylate if you plan to have surgery for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="375545" conceptname="Cataract">cataracts</span> (clouding of the eye). During <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="375545" conceptname="Cataract">cataract</span> surgery, a condition called <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436397" conceptname="Intraoperative floppy iris syndrome">Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome</span> (IFIS) can happen if you take or have taken Doxazosin Mesylate.</p>
<p>• If you use Doxazosin Mesylate with an oral <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4216771" conceptname="Impotence">erectile dysfunction</span> medicine (phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitor), it can cause a sudden drop in your blood pressure and you can become dizzy or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135360" conceptname="Syncope">faint</span>. Talk with your healthcare provider before using PDE-5 inhibitors.</p>
