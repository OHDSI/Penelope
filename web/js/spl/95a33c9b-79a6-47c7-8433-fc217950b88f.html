<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">ASCOMP<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine (Butalbital, Aspirin, 
Caffeine, and Codeine Phosphate Capsules, USP) is a combination drug product 
intended as a treatment for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="376382" conceptname="Tension-type headache">tension headache</span>. ASCOMP<span class="Sup">®</span> 
with Codeine (Butalbital, Aspirin, Caffeine, and Codeine Phosphate Capsules, 
USP) consists of a fixed combination of caffeine 40mg, butalbital 50mg, aspirin 
325mg, and codeine phosphate 30mg. The role each component plays in the relief 
of the complex of symptoms known as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="376382" conceptname="Tension-type headache">tension headache</span> is not completely 
understood.</p>
<a href="#section-"></a><a href="#section-"></a>Pharmacokinetics<a href="#section-"></a><a href="#section-"></a>Bioavailability<p>The bioavailability of the components of the fixed combination of 
ASCOMP<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine (Butalbital, Aspirin, Caffeine, and 
Codeine Phosphate Capsules, USP) is identical to their bioavailability when 
Butalbital, Aspirin, and Caffeine Capsules, USP and codeine are administered 
separately in equivalent molar doses.</p>
<p>The behavior of the individual components is described below.</p>
<a href="#section-"></a><a href="#section-"></a>Aspirin<p>The systemic availability of aspirin after an oral dose is highly 
dependent on the dosage form, the presence of food, the gastric emptying time, 
gastric pH, antacids, buffering agents, and particle size. These factors affect 
not necessarily the extent of absorption of total salicylates but more the 
stability of aspirin prior to absorption.</p>
<p>During the absorption process and after absorption, aspirin is mainly 
hydrolyzed to salicylic acid and distributed to all body tissues and fluids, 
including fetal tissues, breast milk and the central nervous system (CNS). 
Highest concentrations are found in plasma, liver, renal cortex, heart, and 
lung. In plasma, about 50%-80% of the salicylic acid and its metabolites are 
loosely bound to plasma proteins.</p>
<p>The clearance of total salicylates is subject to saturable kinetics; however, 
first-order elimination kinetics are still a good approximation for doses up to 
650 mg. The plasma half-life for aspirin is about 12 minutes and for salicylic 
acid and/or total salicylates is about 3 hours.</p>
<p>The elimination of therapeutic doses is through the kidneys either as 
salicylic acid or other biotransformation products. The renal clearance is 
greatly augmented by an alkaline urine as is produced by concurrent 
administration of sodium <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4285456" conceptname="Bicarbonate">bicarbonate</span> or potassium citrate.</p>
<p>The biotransformation of aspirin occurs primarily in the hepatocytes. The 
major metabolites are salicyluric acid (75%), the phenolic and acyl glucuronides 
of salicylate (15%), and gentisic and gentisuric acid (1%). The bioavailability 
of the aspirin component of butalbital, aspirin, caffeine and codeine phosphate 
capsules is equivalent to that of a solution except for a slower rate of 
absorption. A peak concentration of 8.80 mcg/mL was obtained at 40 minutes after 
a 650 mg dose.</p>
<p>See OVERDOSAGE<span class="Bold"><a href="#section-"></a></span> for toxicity 
information.</p>
<a href="#section-"></a><a href="#section-"></a>Codeine<p>Codeine is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. It 
is rapidly distributed from the intravascular spaces to the various body 
tissues, with preferential uptake by parenchymatous organs such as the liver, 
spleen and kidney. Codeine crosses the blood-brain barrier, and is found in 
fetal tissue and breast milk. The plasma concentration does not correlate with 
brain concentration or relief of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>, however, codeine is not bound to plasma 
proteins and does not accumulate in body tissues.</p>
<p>The plasma half-life is about 2.9 hours. The elimination of codeine is 
primarily via the kidneys, and about 90% of an oral dose is excreted by the 
kidneys within 24 hours of dosing. The urinary secretion products consist of 
free and glucuronide-conjugated codeine (about 70%), free and conjugated 
norcodeine (about 10%), free and conjugated morphine (about 10%), normorphine 
(4%), and hydrocodone (1%). The remainder of the dose is excreted in the 
feces.</p>
<p>At therapeutic doses, the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesic effect</span> reaches a peak within 2 hours and 
persists between 4 and 6 hours.</p>
<p>The bioavailability of the codeine component of ASCOMP<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine (Butalbital, Aspirin, Caffeine, and Codeine 
Phosphate Capsules, USP) is equivalent to that of a solution. Peak 
concentrations of 198 ng/mL were obtained at 1 hour after a 60 mg dose.</p>
<p>SeE OVERDOSAGE for toxicity 
information.</p>
<a href="#section-"></a><a href="#section-"></a>Butalbital<p>Butalbital is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and 
is expected to distribute to most of the tissues in the body. Barbiturates, in 
general, may appear in breast milk and readily cross the placental barrier. They 
are bound to plasma and tissue proteins to a varying degree and binding 
increases directly as a function of lipid solubility.</p>
<p>Elimination of butalbital is primarily via the kidney (59%-88% of the dose) 
as unchanged drug or metabolites. The plasma half-life is about 35 hours. 
Urinary excretion products included parent drug (about 3.6% of the dose), 
5-isobutyl-5-(2,3-dihydroxypropyl) barbituric acid (about 24% of the dose), 
5-allyl-5(3-hydroxy-2-methyl-1-propyl) barbituric acid (about 4.8% of the dose), 
products with the barbituric acid ring hydrolyzed with excretion of urea (about 
14% of the dose), as well as unidentified materials. Of the material excreted in 
the urine, 32% was conjugated.</p>
<p>The bioavailability of the butalbital component of ASCOMP<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine (Butalbital, Aspirin, Caffeine, and Codeine 
Phosphate Capsules, USP) is equivalent to that of a solution except for a 
decrease in the rate of absorption. A peak concentration of 2,020 ng/mL is 
obtained at about 1.5 hours after a 100 mg dose.</p>
<p>The <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> plasma protein binding of butalbital 
is 45% over the concentration range of 0.5 - 20 mcg/mL. This <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">falls</span> within the 
range of plasma protein binding (20% to 45%) reported with other barbiturates 
such as phenobarbital, pentobarbital, and secobarbital sodium. The 
plasma-to-blood concentration ratio was almost unity indicating that there is no 
preferential distribution of butalbital into either plasma or blood cells.</p>
<p>See OVERDOSAGE<span class="Bold"><a href="#section-"></a></span> for toxicity 
information.</p>
<a href="#section-"></a><a href="#section-"></a>Caffeine<p>Like most xanthines, caffeine is rapidly absorbed and distributed 
in all body tissues and fluids, including the CNS, fetal tissues, and breast 
milk.</p>
<p>Caffeine is cleared rapidly through metabolism and excretion in the urine. 
The plasma half-life is about 3 hours. Hepatic biotransformation prior to 
excretion results in about equal amounts of 1-methylxanthine and 1-methyluric 
acid. Of the 70% of the dose that has been recovered in the urine, only 3% was 
unchanged drug.</p>
<p>The bioavailability of the caffeine component for ASCOMP<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine (Butalbital, Aspirin, Caffeine, and Codeine 
Phosphate Capsules, USP) is equivalent to that of a solution except for a 
slightly longer time to peak. A peak concentration of 1,660 ng/mL was obtained 
in less than an hour for an 80 mg dose.</p>

<h1>INDICATIONS &amp; USAGE</h1>
<p class="First">ASCOMP<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine (Butalbital, Aspirin, 
Caffeine, and Codeine Phosphate Capsules, USP) is indicated for the relief of 
the symptom complex of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4200706" conceptname="Tension">tension</span> (or muscle contraction) <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headache</span>.</p>
<p>Evidence supporting the efficacy of ASCOMP<span class="Sup">®</span> with 
Codeine (Butalbital, Aspirin, Caffeine, and Codeine Phosphate Capsules, USP) is 
derived from 2 multi-clinic trials that compared patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="376382" conceptname="Tension-type headache">tension headache</span> 
randomly assigned to 4 parallel treatments: ASCOMP<span class="Sup">®</span> with 
Codeine (Butalbital, Aspirin, Caffeine, and Codeine Phosphate Capsules, USP), 
codeine, (Butalbital, Aspirin, and Caffeine Capsules, USP), and placebo. 
Response was assessed over the course of the first 4 hours of each of 2 distinct 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headaches</span>, separated by at least 24 hours. ASCOMP<span class="Sup">®</span> with 
Codeine (Butalbital, Aspirin, Caffeine, and Codeine Phosphate Capsules, USP) 
proved statistically significantly superior to each of its components 
ASCOMP<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine (Butalbital, Aspirin, Caffeine, and 
Codeine Phosphate Capsules, USP) and to placebo on measures of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> relief.</p>
<p>Evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of ASCOMP<span class="Sup">®</span> 
with Codeine (Butalbital, Aspirin, Caffeine, and Codeine Phosphate Capsules, 
USP) in the treatment of multiple recurrent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headaches</span> is unavailable. Caution in 
this regard is required because codeine and butalbital are habit-forming and 
potentially abusable.</p>

<h1>WARNINGS</h1>
<p class="First">Therapeutic doses of aspirin can cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441202" conceptname="Anaphylaxis">anaphylactic shock</span> and 
other severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">allergic reactions</span>. It should be ascertained if the patient is 
allergic to aspirin, although a specific history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">allergy</span> may be lacking.</p>
<p>Significant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> can result from aspirin therapy in patients with peptic 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4177703" conceptname="Ulcer">ulcer</span> or other gastrointestinal lesions, and in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> 
disorders.</p>
<p>Aspirin administered pre-operatively may prolong the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4219104" conceptname="Bleeding time">bleeding time</span>.</p>
<p>In the presence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="375415" conceptname="Injury of head">head injury</span> or other intracranial lesions, the respiratory 
depressant effects of codeine and other narcotics may be markedly enhanced, as 
well as their capacity for elevating cerebrospinal fluid pressure. Narcotics 
also produce other CNS depressant effects, such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span>, that may further 
obscure the clinical course of patients with head injuries.</p>
<p>Codeine or other narcotics may obscure signs on which to judge the diagnosis 
or clinical course of patients with acute abdominal conditions. </p>
<p>Butalbital and codeine are both habit-forming and potentially abusable. 
Consequently, the extended use of ASCOMP<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine 
(Butalbital, Aspirin, Caffeine, and Codeine Phosphate Capsules, USP) is not 
recommended.</p>
<p>Results from epidemiologic studies indicate an association between aspirin 
and Reye's Syndrome. Caution should be used in administering this product to 
children, including teenagers, with chicken pox or flu.</p>

<p>Aspirin should be used with caution in patients on anticoagulant therapy and 
in patients with underlying hemostatic defects.</p>
<p>Precautions should be taken when administering salicylates to persons with 
known allergies. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">Hypersensitivity</span> to aspirin is particularly likely in patients 
with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="253788" conceptname="Nasal polyp">nasal polyps</span>, and relatively common in those with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span>.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Ultra-rapid Metabolizers of Codeine<p>Some individuals may be ultra-rapid metabolizers due to a 
specific CYP2D6*2x2 genotype. These individuals convert codeine into its active 
metabolite, morphine, more rapidly and completely than other people. This rapid 
conversion results in higher than expected serum morphine levels. Even at 
labeled dosage regimens, individuals who are ultra-rapid metabolizers may 
experience <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> symptoms such as extreme <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">sleepiness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">confusion</span> or shallow 
breathing.</p>
<p>The prevalence of this CYP2D6 phenotype varies widely and has been estimated 
at 0.5 to 1% in Chinese and Japanese, 0.5 to 1% in Hispanics, 1-10% in 
Caucasians, 3% in African Americans, and 16-28% in North Africans, Ethiopians 
and Arabs. Data is not available for other ethnic groups.</p>
<p>When physicians prescribe codeine-containing drugs, they should choose the 
lowest effective dose for the shortest period of time and should inform their 
patients about these risks and the signs of morphine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>. (See PRECAUCTIONS, Nursing Mothers).</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Information for Patients<p>Patients should be informed that this combination product 
contains aspirin and should not be taken by patients with an aspirin 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">allergy</span>.</p>
<p>ASCOMP<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine (Butalbital, Aspirin, Caffeine, 
and Codeine Phosphate Capsules, USP) may impair the mental and/or physical 
abilities required for performance of potentially hazardous tasks such as 
driving a car or operating machinery. Such tasks should be avoided while taking 
ASCOMP<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine (Butalbital, Aspirin, Caffeine, and 
Codeine Phosphate Capsules, USP).</p>
<p>Alcohol and other CNS depressants may produce an additive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4171908" conceptname="Semicoma">CNS depression</span> when 
taken with ASCOMP<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine (Butalbital, Aspirin, 
Caffeine, and Codeine Phosphate Capsules, USP), and should be avoided.</p>
<p>Codeine and butalbital may be habit-forming. Patients should take the drug 
only for as long as it is prescribed, in the amounts prescribed, and no more 
frequently than prescribed.</p>
<p>For information on use in geriatric patients, refer to PRECAUTIONS,Geriatric use.<br></p>
<p>Caution patients that some people have a variation in a liver enzyme and 
change codeine into morphine more rapidly and completely than other people. 
These people are ultra-rapid metabolizers and are more likely to have 
higher-than-normal levels of morphine in their blood after taking codeine which 
can result in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> symptoms such as extreme <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">sleepiness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">confusion</span>, or 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4302536" conceptname="Shallow breathing">shallow breathing</span>. In most cases, it is unknown if someone is an ultra-rapid 
codeine metabolizer.</p>
<p>Nursing mothers taking codeine can also have higher morphine levels in their 
breast milk if they are ultra-rapid metabolizers. These higher levels of 
morphine in breast milk may lead to life-threatening or fatal side effects in 
nursing babies. Instruct nursing mothers to watch for signs of morphine toxicity 
in their infants including increased <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">sleepiness</span> (more than usual), difficulty 
breastfeeding, breathing difficulties, or limpness. Instruct nursing mothers to 
talk to the baby's doctor immediately if they notice these signs and, if they 
cannot reach the doctor right away, to take the baby to an emergency room or 
call 911 (or local emergency services).</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Laboratory Tests<p>In patients with severe hepatic or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198124" conceptname="Kidney disease">renal disease</span>, effects of 
therapy should be monitored with serial liver and/or renal function tests.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Drug Interactions<p>The CNS effects of butalbital may be enhanced by monoamine 
oxidase (MAO) inhibitors.</p>
<p>In patients receiving concomitant corticosteroids and chronic use of aspirin, 
withdrawal of corticosteroids may result in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433667" conceptname="Poisoning by tetanus vaccine">salicylism</span> because corticosteroids 
enhance renal clearance of salicylates and their withdrawal is followed by 
return to normal rates of renal clearance.</p>

pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. This product should be given 
to a pregnant woman only when clearly needed.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Nonteratogenic Effects<p>Although ASCOMP<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine (Butalbital, 
Aspirin, Caffeine, and Codeine Phosphate Capsules, USP) was not implicated in 
the birth defect, a female infant was born with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4070082" conceptname="Lissencephaly">lissencephaly</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4046077" conceptname="Macrogyria">pachygyria</span> and 
heterotopic gray matter. The infant was born 8 weeks prematurely to a woman who 
had taken an average of 90 ASCOMP<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine 
(Butalbital, Aspirin, Caffeine, and Codeine Phosphate Capsules, USP) each month 
from the first few days of pregnancy. The child's development was mildly delayed 
and from one year of age she had partial simple motor <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span>.</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4218977" conceptname="Drug withdrawal seizure">Withdrawal seizures</span> were reported in a two-day-old male infant whose mother 
had taken a butalbital-containing drug during the last 2 months of pregnancy. 
Butalbital was found in the infant's serum. The infant was given phenobarbital 5 
mg/kg, which was tapered without further <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> or other withdrawal 
symptoms.</p>
<p>Studies of aspirin use in pregnant women have not shown that aspirin 
increases the risk of abnormalities when administered during the first trimester 
of pregnancy. In controlled studies involving 41,337 pregnant women and their 
offspring, there was no evidence that aspirin taken during pregnancy caused 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443213" conceptname="Stillbirth">stillbirth</span>, neonatal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> or reduced birth weight. In controlled studies of 
50,282 pregnant women and their offspring, aspirin administration in moderate 
and heavy doses during the first four lunar months of pregnancy showed no 
teratogenic effect.</p>
<p>Reproduction studies have been performed in rabbits and rats at doses up to 
150 times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or 
harm to the fetus due to codeine.</p>
<p>Therapeutic doses of aspirin in pregnant women close to term may cause 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> in mother, fetus, or neonate. During the last 6 months of pregnancy, 
regular use of aspirin in high doses may prolong pregnancy and delivery.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Labor and Delivery<p>Ingestion of aspirin prior to delivery may prolong delivery or 
lead to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> in the mother or neonate. Use of codeine during labor may lead 
to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> in the neonate.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Nursing Mothers<p>Aspirin, caffeine, barbiturates and codeine are excreted in 
breast milk in small amounts, but the significance of their effects on nursing 
infants is not known. Because of potential for serious adverse reactions in 
nursing infants from ASCOMP<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine (Butalbital, 
Aspirin, Caffeine, and Codeine Phosphate Capsules, USP), a decision should be 
made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into 
account the importance of the drug to the mother.</p>
<p>Codeine is secreted into human milk. In women with normal codeine metabolism 
(normal CYP2D6 activity), the amount of codeine secreted into human milk is low 
and dose-dependent. Despite the common use of codeine products to manage 
postpartum <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>, reports of adverse events in infants are rare. However, some 
women are ultra-rapid metabolizers of codeine. These women achieve 
higher-than-expected serum levels of codeine's active metabolite, morphine, 
leading to higher-than-expected levels of morphine in breast milk and 
potentially dangerously high serum morphine levels in their breastfed infants. 
Therefore, maternal use of codeine can potentially lead to serious adverse 
reactions, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>, in nursing infants.</p>
<p>The prevalence of this CYP2D6 phenotype varies widely and has been estimated 
at 0.5 to 1% in Chinese and Japanese, 0.5 to 1% in Hispanics, 1-10% in 
Caucasians, 3% in African Americans, and 16-28% in North Africans, Ethiopians 
and Arabs. Data is not available for other ethnic groups.</p>
<p>The risk of infant exposure to codeine and morphine through breast milk 
should be weighed against the benefits of breastfeeding for both the mother and 
baby. Caution should be exercised when codeine is administered to a nursing 
woman. If a codeine containing product is selected, the lowest dose should be 
prescribed for the shortest period of time to achieve the desired clinical 
effect. Mothers using codeine should be informed about when to seek immediate 
medical care and how to identify the signs and symptoms of neonatal toxicity, 
such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span> or sedation, difficulty breastfeeding, breathing 
difficulties, and decreased tone, in their baby. Nursing mothers who are 
ultra-rapid metabolizers may also experience <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> symptoms such as extreme 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">sleepiness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">confusion</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4302536" conceptname="Shallow breathing">shallow breathing</span>. Prescribers should closely monitor 
mother-infant pairs and notify treating pediatricians about the use of codeine 
during breastfeeding.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Pediatric Use<p>Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been 
established.</p>
<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Geriatric Use<p>Clinical studies of ASCOMP<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine 
(Butalbital, Aspirin, Caffeine, and Codeine Phosphate Capsules, USP) did not 
include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether 
they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical 
experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and 
younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be 
cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the 
greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of 
concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p>
<p>Butalbital is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk 
of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal 
function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal 
function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to 
monitor renal function.</p>

<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373995" conceptname="Delirium">delirium</span>) may occur within 16 hours and last up to 5 days after abrupt cessation 
of these drugs. Intensity of withdrawal symptoms gradually declines over a 
period of approximately 15 days. Treatment of barbiturate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> consists of 
cautious and gradual withdrawal of the drug. Barbiturate-dependent patients can 
be withdrawn by using a number of different withdrawal regimens. One method 
involves initiating treatment at the patient's regular dosage level and 
gradually decreasing the daily dosage as tolerated by the patient.</p>

<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<p class="First">The toxic effects of acute overdosage of ASCOMP<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine (Butalbital, Aspirin, Caffeine, and Codeine 
Phosphate Capsules, USP) are attributable mainly to the barbiturate and codeine 
components, and, to a lesser extent, aspirin. Because toxic effects of caffeine 
occur in very high dosages only, the possibility of significant caffeine 
toxicity from ASCOMP<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine (Butalbital, Aspirin, 
Caffeine, and Codeine Phosphate Capsules, USP) overdosage is unlikely.</p>

<a href="http://"></a><a href="http://"></a>Treatment<p>The following paragraphs describe one approach to the treatment 
of overdosage with ASCOMP<span class="Sup">®</span> with Codeine (Butalbital, 
Aspirin, Caffeine, and Codeine Phosphate Capsules, USP). However, because 
strategies for the management of an <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> continually evolve, consultation 
with a regional poison control center is strongly encouraged.</p>
<p>Treatment consists primarily of management of barbiturate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">intoxication</span>, 
reversal of the effects of codeine, and the correction of the acid-base 
imbalance due to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433667" conceptname="Poisoning by tetanus vaccine">salicylism</span>. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">Vomiting</span> should be induced mechanically or with 
emetics in the conscious patient. Gastric lavage may be used if the pharyngeal 
and laryngeal reflexes are present and if less than 4 hours have elapsed since 
ingestion. A cuffed endotracheal tube should be inserted before gastric lavage 
of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="372448" conceptname="Loss of consciousness">unconscious</span> patient and when necessary to provide assisted respiration. 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79936" conceptname="Polyuria">Diuresis</span>, alkalinization of the urine, and correction of electrolyte 
disturbances should be accomplished through administration of intravenous fluids 
such as 1% sodium <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4285456" conceptname="Bicarbonate">bicarbonate</span> and 5% dextrose in water.</p>
<p>Meticulous attention should be given to maintaining adequate pulmonary 
ventilation. The value of vasopressor agents such as Norepinephrine or 
Phenylephrine Hydrochloride in treating <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> is questionable since they 
increase <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4137788" conceptname="Vascular constriction">vasoconstriction</span> and decrease blood flow. However, if prolonged support 
of blood pressure is required, Norepinephrine Bitartrate (Levophed<span class="Sup">®</span>) may be given I.V. with the usual precautions and serial 
blood pressure monitoring. In severe cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">intoxication</span>, peritoneal dialysis, 
hemodialysis, or exchange transfusion may be lifesaving. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4253058" conceptname="Factor II deficiency">Hypoprothrombinemia</span> 
should be treated with vitamin K, intravenously. </p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432882" conceptname="Methemoglobinemia">Methemoglobinemia</span> over 30% should be treated with methylene blue by slow 
intravenous administration.</p>
<p>Naloxone, a narcotic antagonist, can reverse <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380834" conceptname="Coma">coma</span> 
associated with opioid <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>. Typically, a dose of 0.4 to 2 mg is given 
parenterally and may be repeated if an adequate response is not achieved. Since 
the duration of action of codeine may exceed that of the antagonist, the patient 
should be kept under continued surveillance and repeated doses of the antagonist 
should be administered as needed to maintain adequate respiration. A narcotic 
antagonist should not be administered in the absence of clinically significant 
respiratory or cardiovascular <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>.</p>
<p>Up-to-date information about the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> can be obtained from a 
Certified Regional Poison Control Center. Telephone numbers of Certified 
Regional Poison Control Centers are listed in the Physicians' Desk
