<h1>II. CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">The combination treatment regimen of psoralen (P) and ultraviolet radiation of 320-400 nm wavelength commonly referred to as UVA is known by the acronym, PUVA. Skin reactivity to UVA (320-400 nm) radiation is markedly enhanced by the ingestion of methoxsalen. In a well controlled bioavailability study, Oxsoralen-Ultra Capsules reached peak drug levels in the blood of test subjects between 0.5 and 4 hours (Mean = 1.8 hours) as compared to between 1.5 and 6 hours (Mean = 3.0 hours) for regular Oxsoralen when administered with 8 ounces of milk. Peak drug levels were 2 to 3 fold greater when the overall extent of drug absorption was approximately two fold greater for Oxsoralen-Ultra Capsules as compared to regular Oxsoralen Capsules. Detectable methoxsalen levels were observed up to 12 hours post dose. The drug half-life is approximately 2 hours. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4080920" conceptname="Phytophotodermatitis">Photosensitivity</span> studies demonstrate a shorter time of peak <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4080920" conceptname="Phytophotodermatitis">photosensitivity</span> of 1.5 to 2.1 hours vs. 3.9 to 4.25 hours for regular Oxsoralen capsules. In addition, the mean minimal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137193" conceptname="Erythema">erythema</span> dose (MED), J/cm<span class="Sup">2</span>, for the Oxsoralen-Ultra Capsules is substantially less than that required for regular Oxsoralen Capsules (Levins et al., 1984 and private communication<span class="Sup">1</span>).</p>
<p>Methoxsalen is reversibly bound to serum albumin and is also preferentially taken up by epidermal cells (Artuc et al., 1979<span class="Sup">2</span>). At a dose which is six times larger than that used in humans, it induces mixed function oxidases in the liver of mice (Mandula et al., 1978<span class="Sup">3</span>). In both mice and man, methoxsalen is rapidly metabolized. Approximately 95% of the drug is excreted as a series of metabolites in the urine within 24 hours (Pathak et al., 1977<span class="Sup">4</span>). The exact mechanism of action of methoxsalen with the epidermal melanocytes and keratinocytes is not known. The best known biochemical reaction of methoxsalen is with DNA. Methoxsalen, upon photoactivation, conjugates and forms covalent bonds with DNA which leads to the formation of both monofunctional (addition to a single strand of DNA) and bifunctional (crosslinking of psoralen to both strands of DNA) adducts (Dallâ€™ Acqua et al., 1971<span class="Sup">5</span>; Cole, 1970<span class="Sup">6</span>; Musajo et al., 1974<span class="Sup">7</span>; Dallâ€™ Acqua et al., 1979<span class="Sup">8</span>). Reactions with proteins have also been described (Yoshikawa, et al., 1979<span class="Sup">9</span>).</p>
<p>Methoxsalen acts as a photosensitizer. Administration of the drug and subsequent exposure to UVA can lead to cell injury. Orally administered methoxsalen reaches the skin via the blood and UVA penetrates well into the skin. If sufficient cell injury occurs in the skin, an <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4053015" conceptname="Inflammation">inflammatory reaction</span> occurs. The most obvious manifestation of this reaction is delayed <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137193" conceptname="Erythema">erythema</span>, which may not begin for several hours and peaks at 48-72 hours. The <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4053015" conceptname="Inflammation">inflammation</span> is followed, over several days to weeks, by repair which is manifested by increased melanization of the epidermis and thickening of the stratum corneum. The mechanisms of therapy are not known. In the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140168" conceptname="Psoriasis">psoriasis</span>, the mechanism is most often assumed to be DNA photodamage and resulting decrease in cell proliferation but other vascular, leukocyte, or cell regulatory mechanisms may also be playing some role. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140168" conceptname="Psoriasis">Psoriasis</span> is a hyper-proliferative disorder and other agents known to be therapeutic for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140168" conceptname="Psoriasis">psoriasis</span> are known to inhibit DNA synthesis.</p>

<h1>V. WARNINGS - GENERAL</h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">A. SKIN BURNING: </span>Serious <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4022094" conceptname="Thermal burn">burns</span> from either UVA or sunlight (even through window glass) can result if the recommended dosage of the drug and/or exposure schedules are exceeded.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">B. CARCINOGENICITY:</span></p>
<ol class="Arabic">
<li><p class="First">ANIMAL STUDIES: Topical or intraperitoneal methoxsalen has been reported to be a potent photocarcinogen in albino mice and hairless mice (Hakim et al., 1960<span class="Sup">10</span>). However, methoxsalen given by the oral route to Swiss albino mice suggests this agent exerts a protective effect against ultraviolet carcinogenesis; mice given 8-methoxypsoralen in their diet showed 38% ear tumors 180 days after the start of ultraviolet therapy compared to 62% for controls (Oâ€™Neal et al., 1957<span class="Sup">11</span>).</p></li>
<li><p class="First">HUMAN STUDIES: A 5.7 year prospective study of 1380 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140168" conceptname="Psoriasis">psoriasis</span> patients treated with oral methoxsalen and ultraviolet A photochemotherapy (PUVA) demonstrated that the risk of cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma developing at least 22 months following the first PUVA exposure was approximately 12.8 times higher in the high dose patients than in the low dose patients (Stern et al., 1979<span class="Sup">12</span>, Stern et al., 1980<span class="Sup">13</span>, and Stern et al., 1984<span class="Sup">14</span>). The substantial dose-dependent increase was observed in patients with neither a prior history of skin cancer nor significant exposure to cutaneous carcinogens. Reduction in PUVA dosage significantly reduces the risk. No substantial dose related increase was noted for basal cell carcinoma according to Stern et al., 1984<span class="Sup">14</span>. Increases appear greatest in patients who have pre-PUVA exposure to 1) prolonged tar and UVB treatment, 2) ionizing radiation, or 3) arsenic. Roenigk et al., 1980<span class="Sup">15</span>, studied 690 patients for up to 4 years and found no increase in the risk of non-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4049499" conceptname="Malignant melanoma">melanoma skin</span> cancer, although patients in this cohort had significantly less exposure to PUVA than in the Stern et al. study. Recent analysis of new data in the Stern et al cohort (Stern et al., 1997<span class="Sup">16</span>) has shown that these patients had an elevated relative risk of contracting melanoma. The relative risk for melanoma in these patients was 2.3 (95 percent confidence interval 1.1 to 4.1). The risk is particularly higher in those patients who have received more than 250 PUVA treatments and in those whose treatment has spanned greater than 15 years earlier. Some patients developing melanoma did so even after having ceased PUVA therapy over 5 years earlier. These observations indicate the need for monitoring of PUVA patients for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135777" conceptname="Neoplasm of uncertain behavior of skin">skin tumors</span> throughout their lives. In a study in Indian patients treated for 4 years for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138502" conceptname="Vitiligo">vitiligo</span>, 12 percent developed keratoses, but not cancer, in the depigmented, vitiliginous areas (Mosher, 1980<span class="Sup">17</span>). Clinically, the keratoses were keratotic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4105835" conceptname="Papule">papules</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138825" conceptname="Actinic keratosis">actinic keratosis</span>-like <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4010895" conceptname="Macule">macules</span>, nonscaling dome-shaped <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4105835" conceptname="Papule">papules</span>, and lichenoid porokeratotic-like <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4105835" conceptname="Papule">papules</span>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><span class="Bold">C. CATARACTOGENICITY:</span></p>
<ol class="Arabic">
<li><p class="First">ANIMAL STUDIES: Exposure to large doses of UVA causes <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="375545" conceptname="Cataract">cataracts</span> in animals, and this effect is enhanced by the administration of methoxsalen (Cloud et al., 1960<span class="Sup">18</span>; Cloud et al., 1961<span class="Sup">19</span>; Freeman et al., 1969<span class="Sup">20</span>).</p></li>
<li><p class="First">HUMAN STUDIES: It has been found that the concentration of methoxsalen in the lens is proportional to the serum level. If the lens is exposed to UVA during the time methoxsalen is present in the lens, photochemical action may lead to irreversible binding of methoxsalen to proteins and the DNA components of the lens (Lerman et al., 1980<span class="Sup">21</span>). However, if the lens is shielded from UVA, the methoxsalen will diffuse out of the lens in a 24 hour period (Lerman et al., 1980<span class="Sup">21</span>). Patients should be told emphatically to wear UVA absorbing, wrap-around sunglasses for the twenty-four (24) hour period following ingestion of methoxsalen whether exposed to direct or indirect sunlight in the open or through a window glass. Among patients using proper eye protection, there is no evidence for a significantly increased risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="375545" conceptname="Cataract">cataracts</span> in association with PUVA therapy (Stern et al., 1979<span class="Sup">12</span>). Thirty-five of 1380 patients have developed <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="375545" conceptname="Cataract">cataracts</span> in the five years since their first PUVA treatment. This incidence is comparable to that expected in a population of this size and age distribution. No relationship between PUVA dose and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="375545" conceptname="Cataract">cataract</span> risk in this group has been noted.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><span class="Bold">D. ACTINIC DEGENERATION: </span>Exposure to sunlight and/or ultraviolet radiation may result in â€œpremature agingâ€? of the skin.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">E. BASAL CELL CARCINOMAS: </span>Patients exhibiting multiple basal cell carcinomas or having a history of basal cell carcinomas should be diligently observed and treated.</p>

<h2>A. GENERAL - APPLICABLE TO <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140168" conceptname="Psoriasis">PSORIASIS</span> TREATMENT:</h2>
<ol class="Arabic">
<li><p class="First">BEFORE METHOXSALEN INGESTION<br>Patients must not sunbathe during the 24 hours prior to methoxsalen ingestion and UV exposure. The presence of a sunburn may prevent an accurate evaluation of the patientâ€™s response to photochemotherapy.</p></li>
<li>
<p class="First">AFTER METHOXSALEN INGESTION</p>
<ol class="LittleAlpha">
<li><p class="First">UVA-absorbing wrap-around sunglasses should be worn during daylight for 24 hours after methoxsalen ingestion. The protective eyewear must be designed to prevent entry of stray radiation to the eyes, including that which may enter from the sides of the eyewear. The protective eyewear is used to prevent the irreversible binding of methoxsalen to the proteins and DNA components of the lens. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="375545" conceptname="Cataract">Cataracts</span> form when enough of the binding occurs. Visual discrimination should be permitted by the eyewear of patient well-being and comfort.</p></li>
<li><p class="First">Patients must avoid sun exposure, even through window glass or cloud cover, for at least 8 hours after methoxsalen ingestion. If sun exposure cannot be avoided, the patient should wear protective devices such as a hat and gloves, and/or apply sunscreens which contain ingredients that filter out UVA radiation (e.g., sunscreens containing benzophenone and/or PABA esters which exhibit a sun protective factor equal to or greater than 15). These chemical sunscreens should be applied to all areas that might be exposed to the sun (including lips). Sunscreens should not be applied to areas affected by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140168" conceptname="Psoriasis">psoriasis</span> until after the patient has been treated in the UVA chamber.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p class="First">DURING PUVA THERAPY</p>
<ol class="LittleAlpha">

If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169287" conceptname="Itching of skin">pruritus</span> is unresponsive to these measures, shield pruritic areas from further UVA exposure until the condition resolves.

<li><p class="First">IMPORTANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PUVA <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137193" conceptname="Erythema">ERYTHEMA</span> AND SUNBURN: PUVA-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4053015" conceptname="Inflammation">inflammation</span> differs from sunburn or UVB phototherapy in several ways. The percent transmission of UVB varies between 0% to 34% through skin whereas UVA varies between 1% to 80% transmission; thus, UVA is transmitted to a larger percent through the skin. (Diffey, 1982<span class="Sup">22</span>). The DNA lesions induced by PUVA are very different from UV-induced thymine dimers and may lead to a DNA crosslink. This DNA lesion may be more problematic to the cell because crosslinks are more lethal and psoralen-DNA photoproducts may be â€œnewâ€? or unfamiliar substrates for DNA repair enzymes. DNA synthesis is also suppressed longer after PUVA. The time course of delayed <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137193" conceptname="Erythema">erythema</span> is different with PUVA and may not involve the usual mediators seen in sunburn. PUVA-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137193" conceptname="Erythema">redness</span> may be just beginning at 24 hours, when UVB <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137193" conceptname="Erythema">erythema</span> has already passed its peak. The <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137193" conceptname="Erythema">erythema</span> dose-response curve is also steeper for PUVA. Compared to equally erythemogenic doses of UVB, the histologic alterations induced by PUVA show more dermal vessel damage and longer duration of epidermal and dermal abnormalities.</p></li>

<p>If the MPD is done, start at 1/2 MPD.</p>
<p>Additional drug dosage directions are as follows:</p>
<ol class="LittleAlpha">
<li><p class="First">Weight Change: In the event that the weight of a patient changes during treatment such that he/she <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">falls</span> into an adjacent weight range/dose category, no change in the dose of methoxsalen is usually required. If, in the physicianâ€™s opinion, however, a weight change is sufficiently great to modify the drug dose, then an adjustment in the time of exposure to UVA should be made.</p></li>
<li><p class="First">Dose/Week: The number of doses per week of methoxsalen capsules will be determined by the patientâ€™s schedule of UVA exposures. In no case should treatments be given more often than once every other day because the full extent of phototoxic reactions may not be evident until 48 hours after each exposure.</p></li>
<li><p class="First">Dosage Increase: Dosage may be increased by 10 mg. after the fifteenth treatment under the conditions outlined in section XI.B.4.b.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><span class="Bold">X. UVA RADIATION SOURCE SPECIFICATIONS &amp; INFORMATION</span></p>
<p><span class="Bold">A. IRRADIANCE UNIFORMITY:</span></p>
<p>The following specifications should be met with the window of the detector held in a vertical plane:</p>
<ol class="Arabic">
<li><p class="First">Vertical variation: For readings taken at any point along the vertical center axis of the chamber (to within 15 cm from the top and bottom), the lowest reading should not be less than 70 percent of the highest reading.</p></li>
<li><p class="First">Horizontal variation: Throughout any specific horizontal plane, the lowest reading must be at least 80 percent of the highest reading, excluding the peripheral 3 cm of the patient treatment space.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><span class="Bold">B. PATIENT SAFETY FEATURES:</span></p>
<p>The following safety features should be present: (1) Protection from electrical hazard: All units should be grounded and conform to applicable electrical codes. The patient or operator should not be able to touch any live electrical parts. There should be ground fault protection. (2) Protective shielding of lamps: The patient should not be able to come in contact with the bare lamps. In the event of lamp breakage, the patient should not be exposed to broken lamp components. (3) Hand rails and hand holds: Appropriate supports should be available to the patient. (4) Patient viewing window: A window which blocks UV should be provided for viewing the patient during treatment. (5) Door and latches: Patients should be able to open the door from the inside with only slight pressure to the door. (6) Non-skid floor: The floor should be of a non-skid nature. (7) Thermoregulation: Sufficient air flow should be provided for patient safety and comfort, limiting temperature within the UVA radiator cabinet to approximately less than 100Â° F. (8) Timer: The irradiator should be equipped with an automatic timer which terminates the exposure at the conclusion of a pre-set time interval. (9) Patient alarm device: An alarm device within the UVA irradiator chamber should be accessible to the patient for emergency activation. (10) Danger label: The unit should have a label prominently displayed which reads as follows:</p>
<p>DANGER - Ultraviolet Radiation - Follow your physicianâ€™s instructions - Failure to use protective eyewear may result in eye injury.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">C. UVA EXPOSURE DOSIMETRY MEASUREMENTS:</span></p>
<p>The maximum radiant exposure or irradiance (within Â± 15 percent) of UVA (320-400 nm) delivered to the patient should be determined by using an appropriate radiometer calibrated to be read in Joules/cm<span class="Sup">2 </span>or mW/cm<span class="Sup">2</span>. In the absence of a standard measuring technique approved by the National Bureau of Standards, the system should use a detector corrected to a cosine spatial response. The use and recalibration frequency of such a radiometer for a specific UVA irradiator chamber should be specified by the manufacturer because the UVA dose (exposure) is determined by the design of the irradiator, the number of lamps, and the age of the lamp. If irradiance is measured, the radiometer reading in mW/cm<span class="Sup">2</span> is used to calculate the exposure time in minutes to deliver the required UVA in Joules/cm<span class="Sup">2</span> to a patient in the UVA irradiator cabinet. The equation is:</p>
<div class="Figure"><img alt="Equation" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=ae951dc4-9031-43bf-943c-cb2366951f23&amp;name=oxsoralen-02.jpg"></div>
<p>Overexposure due to human error should be minimized by using an accurate automatic timing device, which is set by the operator and controlled by energizing and de-energizing the UVA irradiator lamp. The timing device calibration interval should be specified by the manufacturer. Safety systems should be included to minimize the possibility of delivering a UVA exposure which exceeds the prescribed dose, in the event the timer or radiometer should malfunction.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">D. UVA SPECTRAL OUTPUT DISTRIBUTION:</span></p>

<p><span class="Bold">B. CLEARING PHASE: </span>Specific recommendations for patient treatment are as follows:</p>
<ol class="Arabic">
<li><p class="First">SKIN TYPES I, II, &amp; III. Patients with skin types I, II, and III may be treated 2 or 3 times per week.

The severity and extent of the patientâ€™s <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137193" conceptname="Erythema">erythema</span> may be used to determine whether the next exposure should be shortened, omitted, or maintained at the previous dosage.<br>See <a href="#A2EAAC6A-0DF2-4128-AB53-D04AD9E3D0E2">Adverse Reactions</a> section for additional information.</p></li>
<li><p class="First">SKIN TYPES IV, V, &amp; VI. Patients with skin types IV, V, and VI may be treated 2 or 3 times per week.

If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137193" conceptname="Erythema">erythema</span> occurs, follow instructions outlined above in the procedures for patients with skin types I, II, and III.</p></li>
<li><p class="First"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4307927" conceptname="Erythrodermic psoriasis">ERYTHRODERMIC PSORIASIS</span>. Patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4307927" conceptname="Erythrodermic psoriasis">erythrodermic psoriasis</span> should be treated with special attention because pre-existing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137193" conceptname="Erythema">erythema</span> may obscure observations of possible treatment-related phototoxic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137193" conceptname="Erythema">erythema</span>. These patients may be treated 2 or 3 times per week, as a Type I patient.</p></li>
<li>
<p class="First">MISCELLANEOUS SITUATIONS:</p>
<ol class="LittleAlpha">
<li><p class="First">If there is no response after a total of 10 treatments, the exposure of UVA energy may be increased by an additional 0.5-1.0 Joules/cm<span class="Sup">2</span> above the prior incremental increases for each treatment. (Example: a patient whose exposure dosage is being increased by 1.0 Joule/cm<span class="Sup">2</span> may now have all subsequent doses increased by 1.5-2.0 Joules/cm<span class="Sup">2</span>.)</p></li>
<li><p class="First">If there is no response, or only minimal response, after 15 treatments, the dosage of methoxsalen may be increased by 10 mg (a one-time increase in dosage). This increased dosage may be continued for the remainder of the course of treatment but should not be exceeded.</p></li>
<li><p class="First">If a patient misses a treatment, the UVA exposure time of the next treatment should not be increased. If more than one treatment is missed, reduce the exposure by 0.5 Joules/cm<span class="Sup">2</span> for each treatment missed.</p></li>
<li><p class="First">If the lower extremities are not responding as well as the rest of the body and do not show <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137193" conceptname="Erythema">erythema</span>, cover all other body areas and give 25 percent of the present exposure dose as an additional exposure to the lower extremities. This additional exposure to the lower extremities should be terminated if <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137193" conceptname="Erythema">erythema</span> develops on these areas.</p></li>
<li><p class="First">Non-responsive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140168" conceptname="Psoriasis">psoriasis</span>: If a patientâ€™s generalized <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140168" conceptname="Psoriasis">psoriasis</span> is not responding, or if the condition appears to be worsening during treatment, the possibility of a generalized phototoxic reaction should be considered. This may be confirmed by the improvement of the condition following temporary discontinuance of this therapy for two weeks. If no improvement occurs during the interruption of treatment, this patient may be considered a treatment failure.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="Bold">C. ALTERNATIVE EXPOSURE SCHEDULE:</span></p>
<p>As an alternative to increasing the UVA exposure at each treatment, the following schedule may be followed; this schedule may reduce the total number of Joules/cm<span class="Sup">2</span> received by the patient over the entire course of therapy.</p>
<ol class="Arabic">
<li><p class="First">Incremental increases in UVA exposure for all patients may range from 0.5 to 1.5 Joules/cm<span class="Sup">2</span>, according to the patientâ€™s response to therapy.</p></li>
<li><p class="First">Once Grade 2 clearing (see <a href="#A16F36D0-462B-471F-BD58-CB60D7C93708">Table 2</a>) has been reached and the patient is progressing adequately, UVA dosage is held constant. This dosage is maintained until Grade 4 clearing is reached.</p></li>
<li><p class="First">If the rate of clearing significantly decreases, exposure dosage may be increased at each treatment (0.1-1.5 Joules/cm<span class="Sup">2</span>) until Grade 3 clearing and a satisfactory progress rate is attained. The UVA exposure will be held constant again until Grade 4 clearing is attained. These increases may be used also if the rate of clearing significantly decreases between Grade 3 and Grade 4 response. However, the possibility of a phototoxic reaction should be considered; see Non-responsive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140168" conceptname="Psoriasis">Psoriasis</span>, above.</p></li>
<li><p class="First">In summary, this schedule raises slightly the increments (Joules/cm<span class="Sup">2</span>) of UVA dosage, but limits these increases to those periods when the patient is not responding adequately. Otherwise, the UVA exposure is held at the lowest effective dose.</p></li>

These increases are continued until the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140168" conceptname="Psoriasis">psoriasis</span> is brought under control and the patient is again clear.

If the original maintenance treatment schedule is unable to control the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140168" conceptname="Psoriasis">psoriasis</span>, the schedule may be changed to a more frequent regimen. If a flare occurs less than 6 weeks after the last treatment, 25 percent of the maximum exposure received during the clearing phase, with the clearing schedule received during the clearing phase, may be used and then proceed with the clearing schedule previously followed for this patient. (At 95 percent clearing, follow regular maintenance until the optimum maintenance schedule is determined for the patient.) If more than 6 weeks have elapsed since the last treatment was given, treat patients as if they were beginning therapy insofar as exposure dosages are concerned, since their threshold for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137193" conceptname="Erythema">erythema</span> may have decreased.</p></li>

<dd><span class="Bold">What is Oxsoralen-Ultra (Methoxsalen)?</span></dd>
<dt>Â </dt>
<dd>Oxsoralen-Ultra (methoxsalen) is a drug which has been shown to be effective in the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140168" conceptname="Psoriasis">psoriasis</span> when combined with exposure to a very specific kind of light. The use of the drug <span class="Underline">must </span>be combined with exposure to the special light to product effective therapy.</dd>
<dt>Â </dt>
<dd>Oxsoralen-Ultra represents a new dose form of methoxsalen. This new dosage form of methoxsalen exhibits significantly greater bioavailability and earlier photosensitization onset time than previous methoxsalen dosage forms.</dd>
<dt>B.</dt>
<dd><span class="Bold">What is The Special Light?</span></dd>
<dt>Â </dt>
<dd>Light is classified into many different parts. One part is known as ultraviolet light, which is a normal component of sunlight. Artificial or man-made light sources are now available that produce the special part of light (ultraviolet â€œAâ€?) necessary for the most effective therapy.</dd>
<dt>C.</dt>
<dd><span class="Bold">What is â€œPUVAâ€??</span></dd>
<dt>Â </dt>
<dd>â€œPUVAâ€? is the name of the treatment for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140168" conceptname="Psoriasis">psoriasis</span> and stands for the use of Psoralen drug (Oxsoralen-Ultra) in combination with UltraViolet A light.</dd>

<dd><span class="Bold">What is <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140168" conceptname="Psoriasis">Psoriasis</span>?</span></dd>
<dt>Â </dt>
<dd><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140168" conceptname="Psoriasis">Psoriasis</span> is a skin condition associated with red and scaly patches. The cause of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140168" conceptname="Psoriasis">psoriasis</span> is not known. PUVA (Oxsoralen-Ultra with ultraviolet A light) is used for the treatment of severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140168" conceptname="Psoriasis">psoriasis</span> that has not been helped by other methods of therapy.  </dd>
<dt>E.</dt>
<dd><span class="Bold">What Should The Patient Do Before PUVA Therapy?</span></dd>
<dt>Â </dt>
<dd>Certain other medicines can make you more sensitive to the combination drug and light treatment.  In addition, certain other medical conditions can be aggravated by this treatment.  Before starting treatment, be sure to tell your doctor if you have experienced any of the following:<dl>

<dd>Eye Protection â€“ Make sure that you wear special wrap-around sunglasses that totally block or absorb ultraviolet light. Put them on immediately after taking Oxsoralen-Ultra and continue wearing them for 24 hours if any light is present (even if indirect such as reflection or through window glass). Ordinary sunglasses are not adequate.</dd>
<dt>2.</dt>
<dd>Skin &amp; Lip Protection â€“ Do <span class="Underline">not</span> allow exposure of your <span class="Underline">skin and lips to sunlight </span>for 8 hours after treatment. In addition, do not expose your skin to either sunlight or sun lamps (regardless of safety claims) within 24 hours of a scheduled treatment. It is advisable to wear protective clothing (hat, gloves) to cover as much of your body as possible after treatment as well as using a sun screen product having a protection factor of at least 15 (only use after treatment). </dd>

<dd><span class="Bold">How Long Will The Treatments Last?</span></dd>
<dt>Â </dt>
<dd>May take from six to eight weeks before lesions disappear.  Maintenance treatments are usually needed to keep the disease under control.</dd>

<dd>
<span class="Bold">What Are The Problems Associated With Pregnancy Or Breast Feeding?</span><dl>
<dt>1.</dt>
<dd>Birth control methods should be employed since the effects of PUVA therapy on the unborn child are not known.  If you become pregnant, inform your doctor so that he can determine whether it is necessary for you to temporarily stop therapy.</dd>
<dt>2.</dt>
<dd>Since it is not known whether Oxsoralen-Ultra passes into motherâ€™s milk, it is safer not to breast feed while taking this drug.</dd>

<span class="Bold">What Are The Risks of PUVA Therapy?</span><dl>
<dt>1.</dt>
<dd>Premature skin aging may result from prolonged PUVA therapy, especially with those individuals who tan poorly. This problem is similar to excessive exposure to sunlight.</dd>
<dt>2.</dt>
<dd>There is an increased risk of developing both melanoma and non-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4049499" conceptname="Malignant melanoma">melanoma skin</span> cancer.

<dd>have had coal tar and <span class="Underline">U</span>ltra<span class="Underline">V</span>iolet <span class="Underline">B</span> (UVB) treatment.</dd>
<dt>Â </dt>
<dd>Even though your doctor will be examining you, you should routinely and completely examine yourself for small growths on your skin or skin sores that will not heal.  Immediately report such observations to your doctor.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>3.</dt>
<dd>Since studies have shown that animals with unprotected eyes have developed <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="375545" conceptname="Cataract">cataracts</span> after PUVA therapy, you should have your eyes examined by an ophthalmologist before starting PUVA therapy, after the first year of therapy and every two years thereafter.</dd>
