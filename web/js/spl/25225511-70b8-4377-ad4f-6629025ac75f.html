<h2>Mechanism of Action</h2>
<p class="First">The precise mechanism by which tiagabine exerts its antiseizure effect is unknown, although it is believed to be related to its ability, documented in <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> experiments, to enhance the activity of gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. These experiments have shown that tiagabine binds to recognition sites associated with the GABA uptake carrier. It is thought that, by this action, tiagabine blocks GABA uptake into presynaptic neurons, permitting more GABA to be available for receptor binding on the surfaces of post-synaptic cells. Inhibition of GABA uptake has been shown for synaptosomes, neuronal cell cultures, and glial cell cultures. In rat-derived hippocampal slices, tiagabine has been shown to prolong GABA-mediated inhibitory post-synaptic potentials. Tiagabine increases the amount of GABA available in the extracellular space of the globus pallidus, ventral palladum, and substantia nigra in rats at the ED<span class="Sub">50</span> and ED<span class="Sub">85</span> doses for inhibition of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced tonic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span>. This suggests that tiagabine prevents the propagation of neural impulses that contribute to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> by a GABA-ergic action.</p>
<p>Tiagabine has shown efficacy in several animal models of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span>. It is effective against the tonic phase of subcutaneous PTZ-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> in mice and rats, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> induced by the proconvulsant DMCM in mice, audiogenic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> in genetically <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span>-prone rats (GEPR), and amygdala-kindled <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> in rats. Tiagabine has little efficacy against maximal electroshock <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> in rats and is only partially effective against subcutaneous PTZ-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4265182" conceptname="Clonic seizure">clonic seizures</span> in mice, picrotoxin-induced tonic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> in the mouse, bicuculline-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> in the rat, and photic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span> in photosensitive baboons. Tiagabine produces a biphasic dose-response curve against PTZ- and DMCM-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span>, with attenuated effectiveness at higher doses.</p>
<p>Based on <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> binding studies, tiagabine does not significantly inhibit the uptake of dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, glutamate, or choline and shows little or no binding to dopamine D1 and D2, muscarinic, serotonin 5HT<span class="Sub">1A</span>, 5HT<span class="Sub">2</span>, and 5HT<span class="Sub">3</span>, beta-1 and 2 adrenergic, alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenergic, histamine H2 and H3, adenosine A<span class="Sub">1</span> and A<span class="Sub">2</span>, opiate µ and K<span class="Sub">1</span>, NMDA glutamate, and GABA<span class="Sub">A</span> receptors at 100 µM. It also lacks significant affinity for sodium or calcium channels. Tiagabine binds to histamine H1, serotonin 5HT<span class="Sub">1B</span>, benzodiazepine, and chloride channel receptors at concentrations 20 to 400 times those inhibiting the uptake of GABA.</p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
<p class="First">Tiagabine is well absorbed, with food slowing absorption rate but not altering the extent of absorption. The elimination half-life of tiagabine is 7 to 9 hours in normal volunteers. In <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span> clinical trials, most patients were receiving hepatic enzyme-inducing agents (e.g., carbamazepine, phenytoin, primidone, and phenobarbital). The pharmacokinetic profile in induced patients is significantly different from the non-induced population (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_section_id_dde52103-3cf1-4b66-97fb-1170309b62bb">PRECAUTIONS, General, Use in Non-Induced Patients</a></span>). The systemic clearance of tiagabine in induced patients is approximately 60% greater resulting in considerably lower plasma concentrations and an elimination half-life of 2 to 5 hours. Given this difference in clearance, the systemic exposure after a dose of 32 mg/day in an induced population is expected to be comparable to the systemic exposure after a dose of 12 mg/day in a non-induced population. Similarly, the systemic exposure after a dose of 56 mg/day in an induced population is expected to be comparable to the systemic exposure after a dose of 22 mg/day in a non-induced population.  </p>

<h3><span class="Bold">Absorption and Distribution</span></h3>
<p class="First">Absorption of tiagabine is rapid, with peak plasma concentrations occurring at approximately 45 minutes following an oral dose in the fasting state. Tiagabine is nearly completely absorbed (&gt;95%), with an absolute oral bioavailability of about 90%. A high fat meal decreases the rate (mean T<span class="Sub">max</span> was prolonged to 2.5 hours, and mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> was reduced by about 40%) but not the extent (AUC) of tiagabine absorption. In all clinical trials, tiagabine was given with meals.</p>
<p>The pharmacokinetics of tiagabine are linear over the single dose range of 2 to 24 mg. Following multiple dosing, steady state is achieved within 2 days.</p>
<p>Tiagabine is 96% bound to human plasma proteins, mainly to serum albumin and α1-acid glycoprotein over the concentration range of 10 ng/mL to 10,000 ng/mL. While the relationship between tiagabine plasma concentrations and clinical response is not currently understood, trough plasma concentrations observed in controlled clinical trials at doses from 30 to 56 mg/day ranged from &lt;1 ng/mL to 234 ng/mL.</p>

<h3>Metabolism and Elimination</h3>
<p class="First">  Although the metabolism of tiagabine has not been fully elucidated, <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> and <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> studies suggest that at least two metabolic pathways for tiagabine have been identified in humans: 1) thiophene ring oxidation leading to the formation of 5-oxo-tiagabine; and 2) glucuronidation. The 5-oxo-tiagabine metabolite does not contribute to the pharmacologic activity of tiagabine.</p>
<p>Based on <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> data, tiagabine is likely to be metabolized primarily by the 3A isoform subfamily of hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP 3A), although contributions to the metabolism of tiagabine from CYP 1A2, CYP 2D6 or CYP 2C19 have not been excluded.</p>
<p>Approximately 2% of an oral dose of tiagabine is excreted unchanged, with 25% and 63% of the remaining dose excreted into the urine and feces, respectively, primarily as metabolites, at least 2 of which have not been identified. The mean systemic plasma clearance is 109 mL/min (CV = 23%) and the average elimination half-life for tiagabine in healthy subjects ranged from 7 to 9 hours. The elimination half-life decreased by 50 to 65% in hepatic enzyme-induced patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span> compared to uninduced patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span>.</p>
<p>A diurnal effect on the pharmacokinetics of tiagabine was observed. Mean steady-state C<span class="Sub">min</span>values were 40% lower in the evening than in the morning. Tiagabine steady-state AUC values were also found to be 15% lower following the evening tiagabine dose compared to the AUC following the morning dose.</p>

<h3>Hepatic Insufficiency  </h3>
<p class="First">  In patients with moderate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span> (Child-Pugh Class B), clearance of unbound tiagabine was reduced by about 60%. Patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4326594" conceptname="Abnormal liver function">impaired liver function</span> may require reduced initial and maintenance doses of tiagabine and/or longer dosing intervals compared to patients with normal hepatic function (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_precautions_general_id_3e82f345-85e0-4860-ac20-70f0cc21434e">PRECAUTIONS</a></span>).  </p>

<h3>Pediatric</h3>
<p class="First">  Tiagabine has not been investigated in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials in patients below the age of 12. The apparent clearance and volume of distribution of tiagabine per unit body surface area or per kg were fairly similar in 25 children (age: 3 to 10 years) and in adults taking enzyme-inducing antiepilepsy drugs ([AEDs] e.g., carbamazepine or phenytoin). In children who were taking a non-inducing AED (e.g., valproate), the clearance of tiagabine based upon body weight and body surface area was 2 and 1.5-fold higher, respectively, than in non-induced adults with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span>.</p>

<h3>Gender, Race and Cigarette Smoking</h3>
<p class="First">  No specific pharmacokinetic studies were conducted to investigate the effect of gender, race and cigarette smoking on the disposition of tiagabine. Retrospective pharmacokinetic analyses, however, suggest that there is no clinically important difference between the clearance of tiagabine in males and females, when adjusted for body weight. Population pharmacokinetic analyses indicated that tiagabine clearance values were not significantly different in Caucasian (N=463), Black (N=23), or Hispanic (N=17) patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span>, and that tiagabine clearance values were not significantly affected by tobacco use.</p>

<h3>Interactions with other Antiepilepsy Drugs</h3>
<p class="First">  The clearance of tiagabine is affected by the co-administration of hepatic enzyme-inducing antiepilepsy drugs. Tiagabine is eliminated more rapidly in patients who have been taking hepatic enzyme-inducing drugs, e.g., carbamazepine, phenytoin, primidone and phenobarbital than in patients not receiving such treatment (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_interactions_id_2d168c2d-49c4-425a-9eac-a2b8609816bf">PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions</a></span>).</p>

<h1>CLINICAL STUDIES</h1>
<p class="First">The effectiveness of tiagabine HCl as adjunctive therapy (added to other antiepilepsy drugs) was examined in three multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, clinical trials in 769 patients with refractory <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106574" conceptname="Partial seizure">partial seizures</span> who were taking at least one hepatic enzyme-inducing antiepilepsy drug (AED), and two placebo-controlled cross-over studies in 90 patients. In the parallel-group trials, patients had a history of at least six <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4236312" conceptname="Complex partial epileptic seizure">complex partial seizures</span> (Study 1 and Study 2, U.S. studies), or six <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106574" conceptname="Partial seizure">partial seizures</span> of any type (Study 3, European study), occurring alone or in combination with any other <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> type within the 8-week period preceding the first study visit in spite of receiving one or more AEDs at therapeutic concentrations.</p>
<p>In the first two studies, the primary protocol-specified outcome measure was the median reduction from baseline in the 4-week complex partial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> (CPS) rates during treatment. In the third study, the protocol-specified primary outcome measure was the proportion of patients achieving a 50% or greater reduction from baseline in the 4-week <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> rate of all <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106574" conceptname="Partial seizure">partial seizures</span> during treatment. The results given below include data for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4236312" conceptname="Complex partial epileptic seizure">complex partial seizures</span> and all <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106574" conceptname="Partial seizure">partial seizures</span> for the intent-to-treat population (all patients who received at least one dose of treatment and at least one <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> evaluation) in each study.</p>
<p>Study 1 was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial comparing tiagabine HCl 16 mg/day, tiagabine HCl 32 mg/day, tiagabine HCl 56 mg/day, and placebo. Study drug was given as a four times a day regimen. After a prospective Baseline Phase of 12 weeks, patients were randomized to one of the four treatment groups described above. The 16-week Treatment Phase consisted of a 4-week Titration Period, followed by a 12-week Fixed-Dose Period, during which concomitant AED doses were held constant. The primary outcome was assessed for the combined 32 and 56 mg/day groups compared to placebo.</p>
<p>Study 2 was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial consisting of an 8-week Baseline Phase and a 12-week Treatment Phase, the first 4 weeks of which constituted a Titration Period and the last 8 weeks a Fixed-Dose Period. This study compared tiagabine HCl 16 mg BID and 8 mg QID to placebo. The protocol-specified primary outcome measure was assessed separately for each group treated with tiagabine HCl.</p>

<p>Figures 1 to 4 present the proportion of patients (X-axis) whose percent reduction from baseline in the all partial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> rate was at least as great as that indicated on the Y axis in the three placebo-controlled adjunctive studies (Studies 1, 2, and 3). A positive value on the Y axis indicates an improvement from baseline (i.e., a decrease in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> rate), while a negative value indicates a worsening from baseline (i.e., an increase in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> rate). Thus, in a display of this type, the curve for an effective treatment is shifted to the left of the curve for placebo.</p>
<p>Figure 1 indicates that the proportion of patients achieving any particular level of reduction in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> rate was consistently higher for the combined tiagabine HCl 32 mg and 56 mg groups compared to the placebo group in Study 1. For example, Figure 1 indicates that approximately 24% of patients treated with tiagabine HCl experienced a 50% or greater reduction, compared to 4% in the placebo group. </p>

The proportion of patients achieving any particular level of reduction in all partial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> rates was consistently higher as the dose of tiagabine HCl was increased.

<p>Study 3 was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial that compared tiagabine HCl 10 mg TID (N=77) with placebo (N=77). In this trial, patients were followed prospectively during a 12-week Baseline Phase and then randomized to receive study drug during an 18-week Treatment Phase. During the first 6 weeks of treatment (Titration Period), patients were titrated to 30 mg/day, after which they were maintained on this dose during the 12-week Fixed-Dose Period. The protocol-specified primary outcome measure (proportion of patients who achieved at least a 50% reduction from baseline in partial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> rate) did not reach statistical significance. However, analyses of the median reduction from baseline in 4-week partial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> rate (the analyses presented above for Study 1 and Study 2) were performed and showed a statistically significant improvement compared to placebo in all partial and complex partial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> rates (Table 3):</p>

<p>The two other placebo-controlled trials that examined the effectiveness of tiagabine HCl were small cross-over trials (N=46 and 44). Both trials included an open Screening Phase during which patients were titrated to an optimal dose and then treated with this dose for an additional 4 weeks. After this Open Phase, patients were randomized to one of two blinded treatment sequences (tiagabine HCl followed by placebo or placebo followed by tiagabine HCl). The Double-Blind Phase consisted of two Treatment Periods, each lasting 7 weeks (with a 3 week washout between periods). The outcome measures were median with-in patient differences between placebo and tiagabine HCl Treatment Periods in 4-week complex partial and all partial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> rates.

<h2><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4322252" conceptname="Suicidal behavior">Suicidal Behavior</span> and Ideation</h2>
<p class="First">  Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including tiagabine HCl, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.</p>
<p>Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4322252" conceptname="Suicidal behavior">suicidal behavior</span> or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicides</span> in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicide</span>.</p>
<p>The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed.</p>
<p>The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5-100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed.</p>
<p>Table 4 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs.</p>

<h2>Cognitive/Neuropsychiatric Adverse Events</h2>
<p class="First">  Adverse events most often associated with the use of tiagabine HCl were related to the central nervous system. The most significant of these can be classified into 2 general categories: 1) impaired concentration, speech or language problems, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">confusion</span> (effects on thought processes); and 2) <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223659" conceptname="Fatigue">fatigue</span> (effects on level of consciousness). The majority of these events were mild to moderate. In controlled clinical trials, these events led to discontinuation of treatment with tiagabine HCl in 6% (31 of 494) of patients compared to 2% (5 of 275) of the placebo-treated patients. A total of 1.6% (8 of 494) of the tiagabine HCl treated patients in the controlled trials were hospitalized secondary to the occurrence of these events compared to 0% of the placebo treated patients. Some of these events were dose related and usually began during initial titration.</p>
<p>Patients with a history of spike and wave discharges on EEG have been reported to have exacerbations of their EEG abnormalities associated with these cognitive/neuropsychiatric events. This raises the possibility that these clinical events may, in some cases, be a manifestation of underlying <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> activity (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_lab_tests_id_ededf51d-34d4-4363-a8b2-0e76e73b1509">PRECAUTIONS, Laboratory Tests, EEG</a></span>). In the documented cases of spike and wave discharges on EEG with cognitive/neuropsychiatric events, patients usually continued tiagabine, but required dosage adjustment.</p>
<p>Additionally, there have been postmarketing reports of patients who have experienced cognitive/neuropsychiatric symptoms, some accompanied by EEG abnormalities such as generalized spike and wave activity, that have been reported as nonconvulsant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373748" conceptname="Grand mal status">status epilepticus</span>. Some reports describe recovery following reduction of dose or discontinuation of tiagabine HCl.</p>

<h2><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373748" conceptname="Grand mal status">Status Epilepticus</span></h2>
<p class="First">  In the three double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group studies (Studies 1, 2, and 3), the incidence of any type of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373748" conceptname="Grand mal status">status epilepticus</span> (simple, complex, or generalized tonic-clonic) in patients receiving tiagabine HCl was 0.8% (4 of 494 patients) versus 0.7% (2 of 275 patients) receiving placebo. Among the patients treated with tiagabine HCl across all <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span> studies (controlled and uncontrolled), 5% had some form of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373748" conceptname="Grand mal status">status epilepticus</span>. Of the 5%, 57% of patients experienced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4043559" conceptname="Complex partial status epilepticus">complex partial status epilepticus</span>. A critical risk factor for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373748" conceptname="Grand mal status">status epilepticus</span> was the presence of a previous history; 33% of patients with a history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373748" conceptname="Grand mal status">status epilepticus</span> had recurrence during tiagabine HCl treatment. Because adequate information about the incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373748" conceptname="Grand mal status">status epilepticus</span> in a similar population of patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span> who have not received treatment with tiagabine HCl is not available, it is impossible to state whether or not treatment with tiagabine HCl is associated with a higher or lower rate of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373748" conceptname="Grand mal status">status epilepticus</span> than would be expected to occur in a similar population not treated with tiagabine HCl.</p>

<h2>Sudden Unexpected <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">Death</span> In <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">Epilepsy</span> (SUDEP)</h2>
<p class="First">  There have been as many as 10 cases of sudden unexpected <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> during the clinical development of tiagabine among 2531 patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span> (3831 patient-years of exposure).</p>
<p>This represents an estimated incidence of 0.0026 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> per patient-year. This rate is within the range of estimates for the incidence of sudden and unexpected <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span> not receiving tiagabine HCl (ranging from 0.0005 for the general population with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span>, 0.003 to 0.004 for clinical trial populations similar to that in the clinical development program for tiagabine HCl, to 0.005 for patients with refractory <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span>). The estimated SUDEP rates in patients receiving tiagabine HCl are also similar to those observed in patients receiving other antiepilepsy drugs, chemically unrelated to tiagabine HCl, that underwent clinical testing in similar populations at about the same time. This evidence suggests that the SUDEP rates reflect population rates, not a drug effect.</p>

<h3>Use in Non-Induced Patients</h3>
<p class="First">  Virtually all experience with tiagabine HCl has been obtained in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span> receiving at least one concomitant enzyme-inducing antiepilepsy drug (AED), which lowers the plasma levels of tiagabine. Use in non-induced patients requires lower doses of tiagabine HCl. These patients may also require a slower titration of tiagabine HCl compared to that of induced patients (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_dosage_admin_id_6ee50581-ee06-4529-884a-bf610f3ee5d2">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span>). Patients taking a combination of inducing and non-inducing agents (e.g., carbamazepine and valproate) should be considered to be induced. Patients not receiving hepatic enzyme-inducing agents are referred to as non-induced patients.</p>

<h3>Generalized <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437113" conceptname="Asthenia">Weakness</span></h3>
<p class="First">  Moderately severe to incapacitating generalized <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437113" conceptname="Asthenia">weakness</span> has been reported following administration of tiagabine HCl in 28 of 2531 (approximately 1%) patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span>. The <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437113" conceptname="Asthenia">weakness</span> resolved in all cases after a reduction in dose or discontinuation of tiagabine HCl.</p>

<h3>Binding in the Eye and Other Melanin-Containing Tissues</h3>
<p class="First">When dogs received a single dose of radiolabeled tiagabine, there was evidence of residual binding in the retina and uvea after 3 weeks (the latest time point measured). Although not directly measured, melanin binding is suggested. The ability of available tests to detect potentially adverse consequences, if any, of the binding of tiagabine to melanin-containing tissue is unknown and there was no systematic monitoring for relevant ophthalmological changes during the clinical development of tiagabine HCl. However, long term (up to one year) toxicological studies of tiagabine in dogs showed no treatment-related ophthalmoscopic changes and macro- and microscopic examinations of the eye were unremarkable. Accordingly, although there are no specific recommendations for periodic ophthalmologic monitoring, prescribers should be aware of the possibility of long-term ophthalmologic effects.</p>

<h3>Use in Hepatically-Impaired Patients</h3>
<p class="First">  Because the clearance of tiagabine is reduced in patients with liver disease, dosage reduction may be necessary in these patients.</p>

<h3>Serious <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">Rash</span></h3>
<p class="First">  Four patients treated with tiagabine during the product’s premarketing clinical testing developed what were considered to be serious <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rashes</span>. In two patients, the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span> was described as maculopapular; in one it was described as vesiculobullous; and in the 4th case, a diagnosis of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="141651" conceptname="Stevens-Johnson syndrome">Stevens Johnson Syndrome</span> was made. In none of the 4 cases is it certain that tiagabine was the primary, or even a contributory, cause of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span>. Nevertheless, drug associated <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span> can, if extensive and serious, cause irreversible morbidity, even <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>.</p>

<h3>Information for Patients</h3>
<p class="First">Patients should be informed of the availability of a Medication Guide, and they should be instructed to read it prior to taking tiagabine HCl.  The complete text of the Medication Guide is provided at the end of this labeling.</p>

<h3>Suicidal Thinking and Behavior</h3>
<p class="First"> Patients, their caregivers, and families should be counseled that AEDs, including tiagabine HCl, may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers.</p>
<p>Patients should be advised that tiagabine HCl may cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span>, and other symptoms and signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4171908" conceptname="Semicoma">CNS depression</span>. Accordingly, patients should be advised neither to drive nor to operate other complex machinery until they have gained sufficient experience on tiagabine HCl to gauge whether or not it affects their mental and/or motor performance adversely. Because of the possible additive depressive effects, caution should also be used when patients are taking other CNS depressants in combination with tiagabine HCl.</p>
<p>Because teratogenic effects were seen in the offspring of rats exposed to maternally toxic doses of tiagabine and because experience in humans is limited, patients should be advised to notify their physicians if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy.</p>
<p>Because of the possibility that tiagabine may be excreted in breast milk, patients should be advised to notify those providing care to themselves and their children if they intend to breast-feed or are breast-feeding an infant.</p>
<p>Patients should be encouraged to enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry if they become pregnant. This registry is collecting information about the safety of antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. To enroll, patients can call the toll free number 1-888-233-2334 (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_precautions_general_id_3e82f345-85e0-4860-ac20-70f0cc21434e">PRECAUTIONS</a></span>,<span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_pediatric_use_id_35024cb3-668b-4db8-9fa7-8a3f7a0a41e6">Pregnancy</a></span>).</p>

<h3>Therapeutic Monitoring of Plasma Concentrations of Tiagabine</h3>
<p class="First">  A therapeutic range for tiagabine plasma concentrations has not been established. In controlled trials, trough plasma concentrations observed among patients randomized to doses of tiagabine that were statistically significantly more effective than placebo ranged from &lt;1 ng/mL to 234 ng/mL (median, 10<span class="Sup">th</span> and 90<span class="Sup">th</span> percentiles are 23.7 ng/mL, 5.4 ng/mL, and 69.8 ng/mL, respectively). Because of the potential for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196500" conceptname="Drug interaction">pharmacokinetic interactions</span> between tiagabine HCl and drugs that induce or inhibit hepatic metabolizing enzymes, it may be useful to obtain plasma levels of tiagabine before and after changes are made in the therapeutic regimen.</p>

<h3>Clinical Chemistry and Hematology</h3>
<p class="First">  During the development of tiagabine HCl, no systematic abnormalities on routine laboratory testing were noted. Therefore, no specific guidance is offered regarding routine monitoring; the practitioner retains responsibility for determining how best to monitor the patient in his/her care.</p>

<h3>EEG</h3>
<p class="First">  Patients with a history of spike and wave discharges on EEG have been reported to have exacerbations of their EEG abnormalities associated with cognitive/neuropsychiatric events. This raises the possibility that these clinical events may, in some cases, be a manifestation of underlying <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> activity (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_section_id_56791030-9a8d-4c9b-b698-e1eac379dd88">WARNINGS, Cognitive/Neuropsychiatric Adverse Events</a></span>).

<h2>Drug Interactions</h2>
<p class="First">In evaluating the potential for interactions among co-administered antiepilepsy drugs (AEDs), whether or not an AED induces or does not induce metabolic enzymes is an important consideration. Carbamazepine, phenytoin, primidone, and phenobarbital are generally classified as enzyme inducers; valproate and gabapentin are not. tiagabine HCl is considered to be a non-enzyme inducing AED (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_section_id_dde52103-3cf1-4b66-97fb-1170309b62bb">PRECAUTIONS, General, Use in Non-Induced Patients</a></span>).</p>
<p>The drug interaction data described in this section were obtained from studies involving either healthy subjects or patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span>.</p>

<h3>Effects of Tiagabine HCl on other Antiepilepsy Drugs (AEDs):</h3>
<p class="First"><span class="Underline">Phenytoin:</span> Tiagabine had no effect on the steady-state plasma concentrations of phenytoin in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Underline">Carbamazepine:</span> Tiagabine had no effect on the steady-state plasma concentrations of carbamazepine or its epoxide metabolite in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Underline">Valproate:</span> Tiagabine causes a slight decrease (about 10%) in steady-state valproate concentrations.</p>
<p><span class="Underline">Phenobarbital or Primidone:</span> No formal pharmacokinetic studies have been performed examining the addition of tiagabine to regimens containing phenobarbital or primidone. The addition of tiagabine in a limited number of patients in three well-controlled studies caused no systematic changes in phenobarbital or primidone concentrations when compared to placebo.</p>

<h3>Effects of other Antiepilepsy Drugs (AEDs) on Tiagabine HCl:</h3>
<p class="First"><span class="Underline">Carbamazepine:</span> Population pharmacokinetic analyses indicate that tiagabine clearance is 60% greater in patients taking carbamazepine with or without other enzyme-inducing AEDs.</p>
<p><span class="Underline">Phenytoin:</span> Population pharmacokinetic analyses indicate that tiagabine clearance is 60% greater in patients taking phenytoin with or without other enzyme-inducing AEDs.</p>
<p><span class="Underline">Phenobarbital (Primidone):</span>  Population pharmacokinetic analyses indicate that tiagabine clearance is 60% greater in patients taking phenobarbital (primidone) with or without other enzyme-inducing AEDs.</p>
<p><span class="Underline">Valproate:</span> The addition of tiagabine to patients taking valproate chronically had no effect on tiagabine pharmacokinetics, but valproate significantly decreased tiagabine binding <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> from 96.3 to 94.8%, which resulted in an increase of approximately 40% in the free tiagabine concentration. The clinical relevance of this <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> finding is unknown.</p>

<h3>Interaction of Tiagabine HCl with Other Drugs:</h3>
<p class="First"><span class="Underline">Cimetidine:</span> Co-administration of cimetidine (800 mg/day) to patients taking tiagabine chronically had no effect on tiagabine pharmacokinetics.</p>
<p><span class="Underline">Theophylline:</span> A single 10 mg dose of tiagabine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of theophylline at steady state.</p>
<p><span class="Underline">Warfarin:</span> No significant differences were observed in the steady-state pharmacokinetics of R-warfarin or S-warfarin with the addition of tiagabine given as a single dose. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4173906" conceptname="Clotting factor II assay">Prothrombin</span> times were not affected by tiagabine.</p>
<p><span class="Underline">Digoxin:</span> Concomitant administration of tiagabine did not affect the steady-state pharmacokinetics of digoxin or the mean daily trough serum level of digoxin.</p>
<p><span class="Underline">Ethanol or Triazolam:</span> No significant differences were observed in the pharmacokinetics of triazolam (0.125 mg) and tiagabine (10 mg) when given together as a single dose. The pharmacokinetics of ethanol were not affected by multiple-dose administration of tiagabine. Tiagabine has shown no clinically important potentiation of the pharmacodynamic effects of triazolam or alcohol. Because of the possible additive effects of drugs that may depress the nervous system, ethanol or triazolam should be used cautiously in combination with tiagabine.</p>
<p><span class="Underline">Oral Contraceptives:</span> Multiple dose administration of tiagabine (8 mg/day monotherapy) did not alter the pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives in healthy women of child-bearing age.</p>
<p><span class="Underline">Antipyrine:</span> Antipyrine pharmacokinetics were not significantly different before and after tiagabine multiple-dose regimens. This indicates that tiagabine does not cause induction or inhibition of the hepatic microsomal enzyme systems responsible for the metabolism of antipyrine.</p>

<h3>Interaction of Tiagabine HCl with Highly Protein Bound Drugs:</h3>
<p class="First"><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> data showed that tiagabine is 96% bound to human plasma protein and therefore has the potential to interact with other highly protein bound compounds.

<h2>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis: </span>In rats, a study of the potential carcinogenicity associated with tiagabine HCl administration showed that 200 mg/kg/day (plasma exposure [AUC] 36 to 100 times that at the maximum recommended human dosage [MRHD] of 56 mg/day) for 2 years resulted in small, but statistically significant increases in the incidences of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4301500" conceptname="Liver cell adenoma">hepatocellular adenomas</span> in females and Leydig cell tumors of the testis in males. The significance of these findings relative to the use of tiagabine HCl in humans is unknown. The no effect dosage for induction of tumors in this study was 100 mg/kg/day (17 to 50 times the exposure at the MRHD). No statistically significant increases in tumor formation were noted in mice at dosages up to 250 mg/kg/day (20 times the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis).</p>

<h2>Pregnancy:</h2>
<p class="First">Pregnancy Category C: Tiagabine has been shown to have adverse effects on embryo-fetal development, including teratogenic effects, when administered to pregnant rats and rabbits at doses greater than the human therapeutic dose.</p>
<p>An increased incidence of malformed fetuses (various craniofacial, appendicular, and visceral defects) and decreased fetal weights were observed following oral administration of 100 mg/kg/day to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis. This dose is approximately 16 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 56 mg/day, based on body surface area (mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>). Maternal toxicity (transient <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134010" conceptname="Weight decreased">weight loss</span>/reduced maternal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134784" conceptname="Weight increased">weight gain</span> during gestation) was associated with this dose, but there is no evidence to suggest that the teratogenic effects were secondary to the maternal effects. No adverse maternal or embryo-fetal effects were seen at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day (3 times the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis).</p>
<p>Decreased maternal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134784" conceptname="Weight increased">weight gain</span>, increased resorption of embryos and increased incidences of fetal variations, but not malformations, were observed when pregnant rabbits were given 25 mg/kg/day (8 times the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) during organogenesis. The no effect level for maternal and embryo-fetal toxicity in rabbits was 5 mg/kg/day (equivalent to the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis). </p>
<p>When female rats were given tiagabine 100 mg/kg/day during late gestation and throughout parturition and lactation, decreased maternal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134784" conceptname="Weight increased">weight gain</span> during gestation, an increase in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443213" conceptname="Stillbirth">stillbirths</span>, and decreased postnatal offspring viability and growth were found. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Tiagabine should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.</p>
<p>To provide additional information regarding the effects of in utero exposure to tiagabine HCl, physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking tiagabine HCl enroll in the NAAED Pregnancy Registry. This can be done by calling the toll free number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. Information on the registry can also be found at the website <span class="Underline">http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/</span>.</p>

<h2>Use in Nursing Mothers: </h2>
<p class="First">Studies in rats have shown that tiagabine HCl and/or its metabolites are excreted in the milk of that species. Levels of excretion of tiagabine and/or its metabolites in human milk have not been determined and effects on the nursing infant are unknown. Tiagabine HCl should be used in women who are nursing only if the benefits clearly outweigh the risks.</p>

<h2>Pediatric Use:</h2>
<p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 have not been established. The pharmacokinetics of tiagabine were evaluated in pediatric patients age 3 to 10 years (see <span class="Bold"> CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Special Populations, Pediatric</span>).</p>

<h2>Geriatric Use:</h2>
<p class="First">Because few patients over the age of 65 (approximately 20) were exposed to tiagabine HCl during its clinical evaluation, no specific statements about the safety or effectiveness of tiagabine HCl in this age group could be made.</p>

<h2><span class="Bold"> Adverse Event Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials</span></h2>
<p class="First">Table 5 lists treatment-emergent signs and symptoms that occurred in at least 1% of patients treated with tiagabine HCl for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380378" conceptname="Epilepsy">epilepsy</span> participating in parallel-group, placebo-controlled trials and were numerically more common in the tiagabine HCl group. In these studies, either tiagabine HCl or placebo was added to the patient’s current antiepilepsy drug therapy. Adverse events were usually mild or moderate in intensity.</p>
<p>The prescriber should be aware that these figures, obtained when tiagabine HCl was added to concurrent antiepilepsy drug therapy, cannot be used to predict the frequency of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice when patient characteristics and other factors may differ from those prevailing during clinical studies. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be directly compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, or investigators. An inspection of these frequencies, however, does provide the prescribing physician with one basis to estimate the relative contribution of drug and non-drug factors to the adverse event incidences in the population studied.</p>

<p>The effects of tiagabine HCl in relation to those of placebo on the incidence of adverse events and the types of adverse events reported were independent of age, weight, and gender. Because only 10% of patients were non-Caucasian in parallel-group, placebo-controlled trials, there is insufficient data to support a statement regarding the distribution of adverse experience reports by race.</p>

<h2>Other Adverse Events Observed During All Clinical Trials</h2>
<p class="First">Tiagabine HCl has been administered to 2531 patients during all phase 2/3 clinical trials, only some of which were placebo-controlled. During these trials, all adverse events were recorded by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals having adverse events, similar types of events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using modified COSTART dictionary terminology. These categories are used in the listing below. The frequencies presented represent the proportion of the 2531 patients exposed to tiagabine HCl who experienced events of the type cited on at least one occasion while receiving tiagabine HCl. All reported events are included except those already listed above, events seen only three times or fewer (unless potentially important), events very unlikely to be drug-related, and those too general to be informative. Events are included without regard to determination of a causal relationship to tiagabine.</p>
<p>Events are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse events are defined as those occurring in at least 1/100 patients; infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients; rare events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1000 patients.</p>

<p><span class="Bold">Management of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">Overdose</span>:</span> There is no specific antidote for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> with tiagabine HCl. If indicated, elimination of unabsorbed drug should be achieved by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">emesis</span> or gastric lavage; usual precautions should be observed to maintain the airway. General supportive care of the patient is indicated including monitoring of vital signs and observation of clinical status of the patient. Since tiagabine is mostly metabolized by the liver and is highly protein bound, dialysis is unlikely to be beneficial. A Certified Poison Control Center should be consulted for up to date information on the management of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> with tiagabine HCl.</p>

<h2>General:</h2>
<p class="First">The blood level of tiagabine obtained after a given dose depends on whether the patient also is receiving a drug that induces the metabolism of tiagabine. The presence of an inducer means that the attained blood level will be substantially reduced. Dosing should take the presence of concomitant medications into account.</p>
<p>Tiagabine HCl is recommended as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106574" conceptname="Partial seizure">partial seizures</span> in patients 12 years and older.</p>
<p>The following dosing recommendations apply to all patients taking tiagabine HCl:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tiagabine HCl is given orally and should be taken with food.</li>
<li>Do not use a loading dose of tiagabine HCl.</li>
<li>Dose titration: Rapid escalation and/or large dose increments of tiagabine HCl should not be used.</li>
<li>Missed dose(s): If the patient forgets to take the prescribed dose of tiagabine HCl at the scheduled time, the patient should not attempt to make up for the missed dose by increasing the next dose. If a patient has missed multiple doses, patient should refer back to his or her physician for possible re-titration as clinically indicated.</li>
<li>Dosage adjustment of tiagabine HCl should be considered whenever a change in patient’s enzyme-inducing status occurs as a result of the addition, discontinuation, or dose change of the enzyme-inducing agent.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Induced Adults and Adolescents 12 Years or Older:</h2>
<p class="First">  The following dosing recommendations apply to patients who are already taking enzyme-inducing antiepilepsy drugs (AEDs) (e.g., carbamazepine, phenytoin, primidone, and phenobarbital). Such patients are considered induced patients when administering tiagabine HCl.</p>
<p>In adolescents 12 to 18 years old, tiagabine HCl should be initiated at 4 mg once daily. Modification of concomitant antiepilepsy drugs is not necessary, unless clinically indicated. The total daily dose of tiagabine HCl may be increased by 4 mg at the beginning of Week 2. Thereafter, the total daily dose may be increased by 4 to 8 mg at weekly intervals until clinical response is achieved or up to 32 mg/day. The total daily dose should be given in divided doses two to four times daily. Doses above 32 mg/day have been tolerated in a small number of adolescent patients for a relatively short duration.</p>
<p>In adults, tiagabine HCl should be initiated at 4 mg once daily. Modification of concomitant antiepilepsy drugs is not necessary, unless clinically indicated. The total daily dose of tiagabine HCl may be increased by 4 to 8 mg at weekly intervals until clinical response is achieved or, up to 56 mg/day. The total daily dose should be given in divided doses two to four times daily. Doses above 56 mg/day have not been systematically evaluated in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials.</p>
<p>Experience is limited in patients taking total daily doses above 32 mg/day using twice daily dosing. A typical dosing titration regimen for patients taking enzyme-inducing AEDs (induced patients) is provided in Table 7.</p>

<p class="First">  The following dosing recommendations apply to patients who are taking only non-enzyme-inducing AEDs. Such patients are considered non-induced patients:</p>
<p>Following a given dose of tiagabine HCl, the estimated plasma concentration in the non-induced patients is more than twice that in patients receiving enzyme-inducing agents. Use in non-induced patients requires lower doses of tiagabine HCl.

<h1>ANIMAL TOXICOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">In repeat dose toxicology studies, dogs receiving daily oral doses of 5 mg/kg/day or greater experienced unexpected CNS effects throughout the study. These effects occurred acutely and included marked sedation and apparent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="373786" conceptname="Abnormal vision">visual impairment</span> which was characterized by a lack of awareness of objects, failure to fix on and follow moving objects, and absence of a blink reaction. Plasma exposures (AUCs) at 5 mg/kg/day were equal to those in humans receiving the maximum recommended daily human dose of 56 mg/day. The effects were reversible upon cessation of treatment and were not associated with any observed structural abnormality. The implications of these findings for humans are unknown.</p>
