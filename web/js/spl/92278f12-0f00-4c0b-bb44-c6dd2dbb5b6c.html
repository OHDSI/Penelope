<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="43681-6">
<a name="section-2.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>Pharmacodynamics</h2>
<p class="First">The mechanism of action of sertraline is presumed to be linked to its inhibition of CNS neuronal uptake of serotonin (5HT). Studies at clinically relevant doses in man have demonstrated that sertraline blocks the uptake of serotonin into human platelets. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies in animals also suggest that sertraline is a potent and selective inhibitor of neuronal serotonin reuptake and has only very weak effects on norepinephrine and dopamine neuronal reuptake. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies have shown that sertraline has no significant affinity for adrenergic (alpha<span class="Sub">1</span>, alpha<span class="Sub">2</span>, beta), cholinergic, GABA, dopaminergic, histaminergic, serotonergic (5HT<span class="Sub">1A</span>, 5HT<span class="Sub">1B</span>, 5HT<span class="Sub">2</span>), or benzodiazepine receptors; antagonism of such receptors has been hypothesized to be associated with various anticholinergic, sedative, and cardiovascular effects for other psychotropic drugs. The chronic administration of sertraline was found in animals to down regulate brain norepinephrine receptors, as has been observed with other drugs effective in the treatment of major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span>. Sertraline does not inhibit monoamine oxidase.</p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics </h2>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-2.2.1"></a><p></p>
<h3>Systemic Bioavailability</h3>
<p class="First">In man, following oral once-daily dosing over the range of 50 to 200 mg for 14 days, mean peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) of sertraline occurred between 4.5 to 8.4 hours post-dosing. The average terminal elimination half-life of plasma sertraline is about 26 hours. Based on this pharmacokinetic parameter, steady-state sertraline plasma levels should be achieved after approximately one week of once-daily dosing. Linear dose-proportional pharmacokinetics were demonstrated in a single dose study in which the Cmax and area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) of sertraline were proportional to dose over a range of 50 to 200 mg. Consistent with the terminal elimination half-life, there is an approximately two-fold accumulation, compared to a single dose, of sertraline with repeated dosing over a 50 to 200 mg dose range. The single dose bioavailability of sertraline tablets is approximately equal to an equivalent dose of solution.</p>
<p>In a relative bioavailability study comparing the pharmacokinetics of 100 mg sertraline as the oral solution to a 100 mg sertraline tablet in 16 healthy adults, the solution to tablet ratio of geometric mean AUC and Cmax values were 114.8% and 120.6%, respectively. 90% confidence intervals (CI) were within the range of 80–125% with the exception of the upper 90% CI limit for Cmax which was 126.5%.</p>
<p>The effects of food on the bioavailability of the sertraline tablet and oral concentrate were studied in subjects administered a single dose with and without food. For the tablet, AUC was slightly increased when drug was administered with food but the Cmax was 25% greater, while the time to reach peak plasma concentration (Tmax) decreased from 8 hours post-dosing to 5.5 hours. For the oral concentrate, Tmax was slightly prolonged from 5.9 hours to 7.0 hours with food.</p>

<h3>Metabolism</h3>
<p class="First">Sertraline undergoes extensive first pass metabolism. The principal initial pathway of metabolism for sertraline is N-demethylation. N-desmethylsertraline has a plasma terminal elimination half-life of 62 to 104 hours. Both <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> biochemical and <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> pharmacological testing have shown N-desmethylsertraline to be substantially less active than sertraline. Both sertraline and N-desmethylsertraline undergo oxidative deamination and subsequent reduction, hydroxylation, and glucuronide conjugation. In a study of radiolabeled sertraline involving two healthy male subjects, sertraline accounted for less than 5% of the plasma radioactivity. About 40–45% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in urine in 9 days. Unchanged sertraline was not detectable in the urine. For the same period, about 40–45% of the administered radioactivity was accounted for in feces, including 12–14% unchanged sertraline.</p>
<p>Desmethylsertraline exhibits time-related, dose dependent increases in AUC (0–24 hour), Cmax and Cmin, with about a 5–9 fold increase in these pharmacokinetic parameters between day 1 and day 14.</p>

<h3>Protein Binding</h3>
<p class="First"><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> protein binding studies performed with radiolabeled <span class="Sup">3</span>H-sertraline showed that sertraline is highly bound to serum proteins (98%) in the range of 20 to 500 ng/mL. However, at up to 300 and 200 ng/mL concentrations, respectively, sertraline and N-desmethylsertraline did not alter the plasma protein binding of two other highly protein bound drugs, viz., warfarin and propranolol (see <a href="#Precautions">PRECAUTIONS</a>).</p>

<h3>Pediatric Pharmacokinetics</h3>
<p class="First">Sertraline pharmacokinetics were evaluated in a group of 61 pediatric patients (29 aged 6–12 years, 32 aged 13–17 years) with a DSM-III-R diagnosis of major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> or obsessive-compulsive disorder. Patients included both males (N=28) and females (N=33). During 42 days of chronic sertraline dosing, sertraline was titrated up to 200 mg/day and maintained at that dose for a minimum of 11 days. On the final day of sertraline 200 mg/day, the 6–12 year old group exhibited a mean sertraline AUC (0–24 hr) of 3107 ng-hr/mL, mean Cmax of 165 ng/mL, and mean half-life of 26.2 hr. The 13–17 year old group exhibited a mean sertraline AUC (0–24 hr) of 2296 ng-hr/mL, mean Cmax of 123 ng/mL, and mean half-life of 27.8 hr. Higher plasma levels in the 6–12 year old group were largely attributable to patients with lower body weights. No gender associated differences were observed. By comparison, a group of 22 separately studied adults between 18 and 45 years of age (11 male, 11 female) received 30 days of 200 mg/day sertraline and exhibited a mean sertraline AUC (0–24 hr) of 2570 ng-hr/mL, mean Cmax of 142 ng/mL, and mean half-life of 27.2 hr. Relative to the adults, both the 6–12 year olds and the 13–17 year olds showed about 22% lower AUC (0–24 hr) and Cmax values when plasma concentration was adjusted for weight. These data suggest that pediatric patients metabolize sertraline with slightly greater efficiency than adults. Nevertheless, lower doses may be advisable for pediatric patients given their lower body weights, especially in very young patients, in order to avoid excessive plasma levels (see <a href="#Dosage_And_Administration">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>).</p>

<a name="section-2.2.5"></a><p></p>
<h3>Age</h3>
<p class="First">Sertraline plasma clearance in a group of 16 (8 male, 8 female) elderly patients treated for 14 days at a dose of 100 mg/day was approximately 40% lower than in a similarly studied group of younger (25 to 32 y.o.) individuals. Steady-state, therefore, should be achieved after 2 to 3 weeks in older patients. The same study showed a decreased clearance of desmethylsertraline in older males, but not in older females.</p>

<a name="section-2.2.6"></a><p></p>
<h3>Liver Disease</h3>
<p class="First">As might be predicted from its primary site of metabolism, liver impairment can affect the elimination of sertraline. In patients with chronic mild liver impairment (N=10, 8 patients with Child-Pugh scores of 5–6 and 2 patients with Child-Pugh scores of 7–8) who received 50 mg sertraline per day maintained for 21 days, sertraline clearance was reduced, resulting in approximately 3-fold greater exposure compared to age-matched volunteers with no <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span> (N=10).  The exposure to desmethylsertraline was approximately 2-fold greater compared to age-matched volunteers with no <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span>.  There were no significant differences in plasma protein binding observed between the two groups.  The effects of sertraline in patients with moderate and severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span> have not been studied.  The results suggest that the use of sertraline in patients with liver disease must be approached with caution. If sertraline is administered to patients with liver impairment, a lower or less frequent dose should be used (see <a href="#Precautions">PRECAUTIONS</a> and <a href="#Dosage_And_Administration">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>). </p>

<h3><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198124" conceptname="Kidney disease">Renal Disease</span></h3>
<p class="First">Sertraline is extensively metabolized and excretion of unchanged drug in urine is a minor route of elimination.  In volunteers with mild to moderate (CLcr=30–60 mL/min), moderate to severe (CLcr=10–29 mL/min) or severe (receiving hemodialysis) <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> (N=10 each group), the pharmacokinetics and protein binding of 200 mg sertraline per day maintained for 21 days were not altered compared to age-matched volunteers (N=12) with no <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span>.  Thus sertraline multiple dose pharmacokinetics appear to be unaffected by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> (see <a href="#Precautions">PRECAUTIONS</a>).</p>

<h3>Major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">Depressive Disorder</span></h3>
<p class="First">The efficacy of ZOLOFT as a treatment for major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> was established in two placebo-controlled studies in adult outpatients meeting DSM-III criteria for major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span>. Study 1 was an 8-week study with flexible dosing of ZOLOFT in a range of 50 to 200 mg/day; the mean dose for completers was 145 mg/day. Study 2 was a 6-week fixed-dose study, including ZOLOFT doses of 50, 100, and 200 mg/day. Overall, these studies demonstrated ZOLOFT to be superior to placebo on the Hamilton <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">Depression</span> Rating Scale and the Clinical Global Impression Severity and Improvement scales. Study 2 was not readily interpretable regarding a dose response relationship for effectiveness.</p>
<p>Study 3 involved depressed outpatients who had responded by the end of an initial 8-week open treatment phase on ZOLOFT 50–200 mg/day. These patients (N=295) were randomized to continuation for 44 weeks on double-blind ZOLOFT 50–200 mg/day or placebo. A statistically significantly lower relapse rate was observed for patients taking ZOLOFT compared to those on placebo. The mean dose for completers was 70 mg/day.</p>
<p>Analyses for gender effects on outcome did not suggest any differential responsiveness on the basis of sex.</p>

<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-2.3.2"></a><p></p>
<h3>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)</h3>
<p class="First">The effectiveness of ZOLOFT in the treatment of OCD was demonstrated in three multicenter placebo-controlled studies of adult outpatients (Studies 1–3). Patients in all studies had moderate to severe OCD (DSM-III or DSM-III-R) with mean baseline ratings on the Yale–Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) total score ranging from 23 to 25.</p>
<p>Study 1 was an 8-week study with flexible dosing of ZOLOFT in a range of 50 to 200 mg/day; the mean dose for completers was 186 mg/day. Patients receiving ZOLOFT experienced a mean reduction of approximately 4 points on the YBOCS total score which was significantly greater than the mean reduction of 2 points in placebo-treated patients.</p>
<p>Study 2 was a 12-week fixed-dose study, including ZOLOFT doses of 50, 100, and 200 mg/day. Patients receiving ZOLOFT doses of 50 and 200 mg/day experienced mean reductions of approximately 6 points on the YBOCS total score which were significantly greater than the approximately 3 point reduction in placebo-treated patients.</p>
<p>Study 3 was a 12-week study with flexible dosing of ZOLOFT in a range of 50 to 200 mg/day; the mean dose for completers was 185 mg/day. Patients receiving ZOLOFT experienced a mean reduction of approximately 7 points on the YBOCS total score which was significantly greater than the mean reduction of approximately 4 points in placebo-treated patients.</p>
<p>Analyses for age and gender effects on outcome did not suggest any differential responsiveness on the basis of age or sex.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of ZOLOFT for the treatment of OCD was also demonstrated in a 12-week, multicenter, placebo-controlled, parallel group study in a pediatric outpatient population (children and adolescents, ages 6–17). Patients receiving ZOLOFT in this study were initiated at doses of either 25 mg/day (children, ages 6–12) or 50 mg/day (adolescents, ages 13–17), and then titrated over the next four weeks to a maximum dose of 200 mg/day, as tolerated. The mean dose for completers was 178 mg/day. Dosing was once a day in the morning or evening. Patients in this study had moderate to severe OCD (DSM-III-R) with mean baseline ratings on the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (CYBOCS) total score of 22. Patients receiving sertraline experienced a mean reduction of approximately 7 units on the CYBOCS total score which was significantly greater than the 3 unit reduction for placebo patients. Analyses for age and gender effects on outcome did not suggest any differential responsiveness on the basis of age or sex.</p>
<p>In a longer-term study, patients meeting DSM-III-R criteria for OCD who had responded during a 52-week single-blind trial on ZOLOFT 50–200 mg/day (n=224) were randomized to continuation of ZOLOFT or to substitution of placebo for up to 28 weeks of observation for discontinuation  due to relapse or insufficient clinical response. Response during the single-blind phase was defined as a decrease in the YBOCS score of ≥ 25% compared to baseline and a CGI-I of 1 (very much improved), 2 (much improved) or 3 (minimally improved). Relapse during the double-blind phase was defined as the following conditions being met (on three consecutive visits for 1 and 2, and for visit 3 for condition 3): (1) YBOCS score increased by ≥ 5 points, to a minimum of 20, relative to baseline; (2) CGI-I increased by ≥ one point; and (3) worsening of the patient's condition in the investigator's judgment, to justify alternative treatment. Insufficient clinical response indicated a worsening of the patient's condition that resulted in study discontinuation, as assessed by the investigator. Patients receiving continued ZOLOFT treatment experienced a significantly lower rate of discontinuation due to relapse or insufficient clinical response over the subsequent 28 weeks compared to those receiving placebo. This pattern was demonstrated in male and female subjects.</p>

<h3><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436074" conceptname="Panic disorder">Panic Disorder</span></h3>
<p class="First">The effectiveness of ZOLOFT in the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436074" conceptname="Panic disorder">panic disorder</span> was demonstrated in three double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (Studies 1–3) of adult outpatients who had a primary diagnosis of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436074" conceptname="Panic disorder">panic disorder</span> (DSM-III-R), with or without <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4321835" conceptname="Agoraphobia">agoraphobia</span>.</p>
<p>Studies 1 and 2 were 10-week flexible dose studies. ZOLOFT was initiated at 25 mg/day for the first week, and then patients were dosed in a range of 50–200 mg/day on the basis of clinical response and toleration. The mean ZOLOFT doses for completers to 10 weeks were 131 mg/day and 144 mg/day, respectively, for Studies 1 and 2. In these studies, ZOLOFT was shown to be significantly more effective than placebo on change from baseline in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4021498" conceptname="Panic attack">panic attack</span> frequency and on the Clinical Global Impression Severity of Illness and Global Improvement scores. The difference between ZOLOFT and placebo in reduction from baseline in the number of full <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4021498" conceptname="Panic attack">panic attacks</span> was approximately 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4021498" conceptname="Panic attack">panic attacks</span> per week in both studies.</p>
<p>Study 3 was a 12-week fixed-dose study, including ZOLOFT doses of 50, 100, and 200 mg/day. Patients receiving ZOLOFT experienced a significantly greater reduction in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4021498" conceptname="Panic attack">panic attack</span> frequency than patients receiving placebo. Study 3 was not readily interpretable regarding a dose response relationship for effectiveness.</p>
<p>Subgroup analyses did not indicate that there were any differences in treatment outcomes as a function of age, race, or gender.</p>
<p>In a longer-term study, patients meeting DSM-III-R criteria for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436074" conceptname="Panic disorder">Panic Disorder</span> who had responded during a 52-week open trial on ZOLOFT 50–200 mg/day (n=183) were randomized to continuation of ZOLOFT or to substitution of placebo for up to 28 weeks of observation for discontinuation due to relapse or insufficient clinical response. Response during the open phase was defined as a CGI-I score of 1(very much improved) or 2 (much improved). Relapse during the double-blind phase was defined as the following conditions being met on three consecutive visits: (1) CGI-I ≥ 3; (2) meets DSM-III-R criteria for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436074" conceptname="Panic disorder">Panic Disorder</span>; (3) number of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4021498" conceptname="Panic attack">panic attacks</span> greater than at baseline. Insufficient clinical response indicated a worsening of the patient's condition that resulted in study discontinuation, as assessed by the investigator. Patients receiving continued ZOLOFT treatment experienced a significantly lower rate of discontinuation due to relapse or insufficient clinical response over the subsequent 28 weeks compared to those receiving placebo. This pattern was demonstrated in male and female subjects.</p>

<h3>Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</h3>
<p class="First">The effectiveness of ZOLOFT in the treatment of PTSD was established in two multicenter placebo-controlled studies (Studies 1–2) of adult outpatients who met DSM-III-R criteria for PTSD. The mean duration of PTSD for these patients was 12 years (Studies 1 and 2 combined) and 44% of patients (169 of the 385 patients treated) had secondary <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span>. </p>
<p>Studies 1 and 2 were 12-week flexible dose studies. ZOLOFT was initiated at 25 mg/day for the first week, and patients were then dosed in the range of 50–200 mg/day on the basis of clinical response and toleration. The mean ZOLOFT dose for completers was 146 mg/day and 151 mg/day, respectively for Studies 1 and 2. Study outcome was assessed by the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale Part 2 (CAPS) which is a multi-item instrument that measures the three PTSD diagnostic symptom clusters of reexperiencing/intrusion, avoidance/numbing, and hyperarousal as well as the patient-rated Impact of Event Scale (IES) which measures intrusion and avoidance symptoms. ZOLOFT was shown to be significantly more effective than placebo on change from baseline to endpoint on the CAPS, IES and on the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) Severity of Illness and Global Improvement scores. In two additional placebo-controlled PTSD trials, the difference in response to treatment between patients receiving ZOLOFT and patients receiving placebo was not statistically significant. One of these additional studies was conducted in patients similar to those recruited for Studies 1 and 2, while the second additional study was conducted in predominantly male veterans. </p>
<p>As PTSD is a more common disorder in women than men, the majority (76%) of patients in these trials were women (152 and 139 women on sertraline and placebo versus 39 and 55 men on sertraline and placebo; Studies 1 and 2 combined). Post hoc exploratory analyses revealed a significant difference between ZOLOFT and placebo on the CAPS, IES and CGI in women, regardless of baseline diagnosis of comorbid major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span>, but essentially no effect in the relatively smaller number of men in these studies. The clinical significance of this apparent gender interaction is unknown at this time. There was insufficient information to determine the effect of race or age on outcome.</p>
<p>In a longer-term study, patients meeting DSM-III-R criteria for PTSD who had responded during a 24-week open trial on ZOLOFT 50–200 mg/day (n=96) were randomized to continuation of ZOLOFT or to substitution of placebo for up to 28 weeks of observation for relapse. Response during the open phase was defined as a CGI-I of 1 (very much improved) or 2 (much improved), and a decrease in the CAPS-2 score of &gt; 30% compared to baseline. Relapse during the double-blind phase was defined as the following conditions being met on two consecutive visits: (1) CGI-I ≥ 3; (2) CAPS-2 score increased by ≥ 30% and by ≥ 15 points relative to baseline; and (3) worsening of the patient's condition in the investigator's judgment. Patients receiving continued ZOLOFT treatment experienced significantly lower relapse rates over the subsequent 28 weeks compared to those receiving placebo. This pattern was demonstrated in male and female subjects.</p>

<h3><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242733" conceptname="Premenstrual dysphoric disorder">Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder</span> (PMDD)</h3>
<p class="First">The effectiveness of ZOLOFT for the treatment of PMDD was established in two double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled flexible dose trials (Studies 1 and 2) conducted over 3 menstrual cycles.  Patients in Study 1 met DSM-III-R criteria for Late Luteal Phase Dysphoric Disorder (LLPDD), the clinical entity now referred to as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242733" conceptname="Premenstrual dysphoric disorder">Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder</span> (PMDD) in DSM-IV.  Patients in Study 2 met DSM-IV criteria for PMDD.  Study 1 utilized daily dosing throughout the study, while Study 2 utilized luteal phase dosing for the 2 weeks prior to the onset of menses.  The mean duration of PMDD symptoms for these patients was approximately 10.5 years in both studies.  Patients on oral contraceptives were excluded from these trials; therefore, the efficacy of sertraline in combination with oral contraceptives for the treatment of PMDD is unknown.</p>
<p>Efficacy was assessed with the Daily Record of Severity of Problems (DRSP), a patient-rated instrument that mirrors the diagnostic criteria for PMDD as identified in the DSM-IV, and includes assessments for mood, physical symptoms, and other symptoms. Other efficacy assessments included the Hamilton <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">Depression</span> Rating Scale (HAMD-17), and the Clinical Global Impression Severity of Illness (CGI-S) and Improvement (CGI-I) scores.</p>
<p>In Study 1, involving n=251 randomized patients; ZOLOFT treatment was initiated at 50 mg/day and administered daily throughout the menstrual cycle.  In subsequent cycles, patients were dosed in the range of 50–150 mg/day on the basis of clinical response and toleration. The mean dose for completers was 102 mg/day.  ZOLOFT administered daily throughout the menstrual cycle was significantly more effective than placebo on change from baseline to endpoint on the DRSP total score, the HAMD-17 total score, and the CGI-S score, as well as the CGI-I score at endpoint.</p>
<p>In Study 2, involving n=281 randomized patients, ZOLOFT treatment was initiated at 50 mg/day in the late luteal phase (last 2 weeks) of each menstrual cycle and then discontinued at the onset of menses.  In subsequent cycles, patients were dosed in the range of 50–100 mg/day in the luteal phase of each cycle, on the basis of clinical response and toleration.  Patients who were titrated to 100 mg/day received 50 mg/day for the first 3 days of the cycle, then 100 mg/day for the remainder of the cycle.  The mean ZOLOFT dose for completers was 74 mg/day. ZOLOFT administered in the late luteal phase of the menstrual cycle was significantly more effective than placebo on change from baseline to endpoint on the DRSP total score and the CGI-S score, as well as the CGI-I score at endpoint.</p>
<p>There was insufficient information to determine the effect of race or age on outcome in these studies.</p>

<p class="First">The effectiveness of ZOLOFT in the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440690" conceptname="Social phobia">social anxiety disorder</span> (also known as social <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440985" conceptname="Phobia">phobia</span>) was established in two multicenter placebo-controlled studies (Study 1 and 2) of adult outpatients who met DSM-IV criteria for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440690" conceptname="Social phobia">social anxiety disorder</span>.</p>
<p>Study 1 was a 12-week, multicenter, flexible dose study comparing ZOLOFT (50–200 mg/day) to placebo, in which ZOLOFT was initiated at 25 mg/day for the first week.  Study outcome was assessed by (a) the Liebowitz Social <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">Anxiety</span> Scale (LSAS), a 24-item clinician administered instrument that measures <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4029621" conceptname="Fear">fear</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span> and avoidance of social and performance situations, and by (b) the proportion of responders as defined by the Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I) criterion of CGI-I ≤ 2 (very much or much improved).  ZOLOFT was statistically significantly more effective than placebo as measured by the LSAS and the percentage of responders.</p>
<p>Study 2 was a 20-week, multicenter, flexible dose study that compared ZOLOFT (50–200 mg/day) to placebo.  Study outcome was assessed by the (a) Duke Brief Social <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440985" conceptname="Phobia">Phobia</span> Scale (BSPS), a multi-item clinician-rated instrument that measures <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4029621" conceptname="Fear">fear</span>, avoidance and physiologic response to social or performance situations, (b) the Marks <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4029621" conceptname="Fear">Fear</span> Questionnaire Social <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440985" conceptname="Phobia">Phobia</span> Subscale (FQ-SPS), a 5-item patient-rated instrument that measures change in the severity of phobic avoidance and distress, and (c) the CGI-I responder criterion of ≤ 2.

<p>Subgroup analyses did not suggest differences in treatment outcome on the basis of gender. There was insufficient information to determine the effect of race or age on outcome. </p>
<p>In a longer-term study, patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440690" conceptname="Social phobia">social anxiety disorder</span> who had responded while assigned to ZOLOFT (CGI-I of 1 or 2) during a 20-week placebo-controlled trial on ZOLOFT 50–200 mg/day were randomized to continuation of ZOLOFT or to substitution of placebo for up to 24 weeks of observation for relapse.  Relapse was defined as ≥ 2 point increase in the Clinical Global Impression – Severity of Illness (CGI-S) score compared to baseline or study discontinuation due to lack of efficacy.  Patients receiving ZOLOFT continuation treatment experienced a statistically significantly lower relapse rate over this 24-week study than patients randomized to placebo substitution.</p>

<h2>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</h2>
<p class="First">ZOLOFT is indicated for the treatment of obsessions and compulsions in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), as defined in the DSM-III-R; i.e., the obsessions or compulsions cause marked distress, are time-consuming, or significantly interfere with social or occupational functioning.</p>
<p>The efficacy of ZOLOFT was established in 12-week trials with obsessive-compulsive outpatients having diagnoses of obsessive-compulsive disorder as defined according to DSM-III or DSM-III-R criteria (see <a href="#Clinical_Trials">Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a>).</p>
<p>Obsessive-compulsive disorder is characterized by recurrent and persistent ideas, thoughts, impulses, or images (obsessions) that are ego-dystonic and/or repetitive, purposeful, and intentional behaviors (compulsions) that are recognized by the person as excessive or unreasonable.</p>
<p>The efficacy of ZOLOFT in maintaining a response, in patients with OCD who responded during a 52-week treatment phase while taking ZOLOFT and were then observed for relapse during a period of up to 28 weeks, was demonstrated in a placebo-controlled trial (see <a href="#Clinical_Trials">Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a>). Nevertheless, the physician who elects to use ZOLOFT for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient (see <a href="#Dosage_And_Administration">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>).</p>

<h2>Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</h2>
<p class="First">ZOLOFT (sertraline hydrochloride) is indicated for the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder in adults.</p>
<p>The efficacy of ZOLOFT in the treatment of PTSD was established in two 12-week placebo-controlled trials of adult outpatients whose diagnosis met criteria for the DSM-III-R category of PTSD (see <a href="#Clinical_Trials">Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a>).</p>
<p>PTSD, as defined by DSM-III-R/IV, requires exposure to a traumatic event that involved actual or threatened <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> or serious injury, or threat to the physical integrity of self or others, and a response which involves intense <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4029621" conceptname="Fear">fear</span>, helplessness, or horror. Symptoms that occur as a result of exposure to the traumatic event include reexperiencing of the event in the form of intrusive thoughts, flashbacks or dreams, and intense psychological distress and physiological reactivity on exposure to cues to the event; avoidance of situations reminiscent of the traumatic event, inability to recall details of the event, and/or numbing of general responsiveness manifested as diminished interest in significant activities, estrangement from others, restricted range of affect, or sense of foreshortened future; and symptoms of autonomic arousal including hypervigilance, exaggerated startle response, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435524" conceptname="Sleep disorder">sleep disturbance</span>, impaired concentration, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4184149" conceptname="Feeling irritable">irritability</span> or outbursts of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4327815" conceptname="Feeling angry">anger</span>.

There has been a long-standing concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment.  Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18–24) with major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older. </p>
<p>The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440374" conceptname="Obsessive-compulsive disorder">obsessive compulsive disorder</span> (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short-term trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4400 patients.  The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 short-term trials (median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk differences (drug vs. placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1000 patients treated) are provided in Table 1.</p>

<p>No <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicides</span> occurred in any of the pediatric trials. There were <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicides</span> in the adult trials, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about drug effect on <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicide</span>.</p>
<p>It is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond several months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> that the use of antidepressants can delay the recurrence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">All patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases.</span></p>

Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the worsening of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality.</p>
<p>Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms.</p>
<p>If the decision has been made to discontinue treatment, medication should be tapered, as rapidly as is feasible, but with recognition that abrupt discontinuation can be associated with certain symptoms (see <a href="#Precautions">PRECAUTIONS</a> and <a href="#Discontinuation_of_Treatment">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION—Discontinuation of Treatment</a> with ZOLOFT, for a description of the risks of discontinuation of ZOLOFT).</p>

<h3>Screening Patients for Bipolar Disorder</h3>
<p class="First">A major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive episode</span> may be the initial presentation of bipolar disorder. It is generally believed (though not established in controlled trials) that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone may increase the likelihood of precipitation of a mixed/<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333677" conceptname="Mania">manic episode</span> in patients at risk for bipolar disorder. Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a conversion is unknown. However, prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4191716" conceptname="Symptoms of depression">depressive symptoms</span> should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">suicide</span>, bipolar disorder, and  <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>.

<p>The concomitant use of ZOLOFT with MAOIs intended to treat psychiatric disorders is contraindicated. ZOLOFT should also not be started in a patient who is being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. All reports with methylene blue that provided information on the route of administration involved intravenous administration in the dose range of 1 mg/kg to 8 mg/kg. No reports involved the administration of methylene blue by other routes (such as oral tablets or local tissue injection) or at lower doses. There may be circumstances when it is necessary to initiate treatment with a MAOI such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue in a patient taking ZOLOFT. ZOLOFT should be discontinued before initiating treatment with the MAOI (see <a href="#Contraindications">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a> and <a href="#Dosage_And_Administration">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>).</p>
<p>If concomitant use of ZOLOFT with other serotonergic drugs including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, buspirone, tryptophan, and St. John's Wort is clinically warranted, patients should be made aware of a potential increased risk for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4154707" conceptname="Serotonin syndrome">serotonin syndrome</span>, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases.</p>
<p>Treatment with ZOLOFT and any concomitant serotonergic agents should be discontinued immediately if the above events occur and supportive symptomatic treatment should be initiated.</p>

<p>ZOLOFT is extensively metabolized by the liver. In patients with chronic mild liver impairment, sertraline clearance was reduced, resulting in increased AUC, Cmax and elimination half-life.  The effects of sertraline in patients with moderate and severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span> have not been studied. The use of sertraline in patients with liver disease must be approached with caution. If sertraline is administered to patients with liver impairment, a lower or less frequent dose should be used (see <a href="#Clinical_Pharmacology">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a> and <a href="#Dosage_And_Administration">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>).</p>
<p>Since ZOLOFT is extensively metabolized, excretion of unchanged drug in urine is a minor route of elimination.

<h2>Information for Patients</h2>
<p class="First">Prescribers or other health professionals should inform patients, their families, and their caregivers about the benefits and risks associated with treatment with ZOLOFT and should counsel them in its appropriate use.  A patient Medication Guide about "Antidepressant Medicines, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">Depression</span> and other Serious Mental Illness, and Suicidal Thoughts or Actions:  is available for ZOLOFT.  The prescriber or health professional should instruct patients, their families, and their caregivers to read the Medication Guide and should assist them in understanding its contents.  Patients should be given the opportunity to discuss the contents of the Medication Guide and to obtain answers to any questions they may have.  The complete text of the Medication Guide is reprinted at the end of this document.</p>
<p>Patients should be advised of the following issues and asked to alert their prescriber if these occur while taking ZOLOFT.</p>

<h3>Clinical Worsening and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">Suicide</span> Risk</h3>
<p class="First">Patients, their families, and their caregivers should be encouraged to be alert to the emergence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitation</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4021498" conceptname="Panic attack">panic attacks</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4184149" conceptname="Feeling irritable">irritability</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4195585" conceptname="Hostile behavior">hostility</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4021344" conceptname="Abusive behavior">aggressiveness</span>, impulsivity, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4108925" conceptname="Akathisia">akathisia</span> (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012381" conceptname="Restlessness">psychomotor restlessness</span>), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333678" conceptname="Hypomania">hypomania</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4333677" conceptname="Mania">mania</span>, other unusual changes in behavior, worsening of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4092095" conceptname="Planning suicide">suicidal ideation</span>, especially early during antidepressant treatment and when the dose is adjusted up or down.  Families and caregivers of patients should be advised to look for the emergence of such symptoms on a day-to-day basis, since changes may be abrupt.  Such symptoms should be reported to the patient's prescriber or health professional, especially if they are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms. Symptoms such as these may be associated with an increased risk for suicidal thinking and behavior and indicate a need for very close monitoring and possibly changes in the medication.</p>
<p>Patients should be cautioned about the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4154707" conceptname="Serotonin syndrome">serotonin syndrome</span> with the concomitant use of SNRIs and SSRIs, including ZOLOFT, and triptans, tramadol, or other serotonergic agents.</p>
<p>Patients should be told that although ZOLOFT has not been shown to impair the ability of normal subjects to perform tasks requiring complex motor and mental skills in laboratory experiments, drugs that act upon the central nervous system may affect some individuals adversely. Therefore, patients should be told that until they learn how they respond to ZOLOFT they should be careful doing activities when they need to be alert, such as driving a car or operating machinery.</p>
<p>Patients should be cautioned about the concomitant use of ZOLOFT and NSAIDs, aspirin, warfarin, or other drugs that affect coagulation since combined use of psychotropic drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and these agents has been associated with an increased risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>.</p>
<p>Patients should be told that although ZOLOFT has not been shown in experiments with normal subjects to increase the mental and motor skill impairments caused by alcohol, the concomitant use of ZOLOFT and alcohol is not advised.</p>
<p>Patients should be told that while no adverse interaction of ZOLOFT with over-the-counter (OTC) drug products is known to occur, the potential for interaction exists. Thus, the use of any OTC product should be initiated cautiously according to the directions of use given for the OTC product.</p>
<p>Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy.</p>
<p>Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they are breast feeding an infant.</p>
<p>ZOLOFT oral concentrate is contraindicated with ANTABUSE (disulfiram) due to the alcohol content of the concentrate.</p>
<p>ZOLOFT Oral Concentrate contains 20 mg/mL of sertraline (as the hydrochloride) as the active ingredient and 12% alcohol. ZOLOFT Oral Concentrate must be diluted before use. Just before taking, use the dropper provided to remove the required amount of ZOLOFT Oral Concentrate and mix with 4 oz (1/2 cup) of water, ginger ale, lemon/lime soda, lemonade or orange juice ONLY. Do not mix ZOLOFT Oral Concentrate with anything other than the liquids listed. The dose should be taken immediately after mixing. Do not mix in advance. At times, a slight haze may appear after mixing; this is normal. Note that caution should be exercised for persons with latex sensitivity, as the dropper dispenser contains dry natural rubber.</p>

<h2>Laboratory Tests</h2>
<p class="First">False-positive urine immunoassay screening tests for benzodiazepines have been reported in patients taking sertraline. This is due to lack of specificity of the screening tests. False-positive test results may be expected for several days following discontinuation of sertraline therapy. Confirmatory tests, such as gas chromatography/<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4041088" conceptname="Mass">mass</span> spectrometry, will distinguish sertraline from benzodiazepines.</p>

<a name="section-6.6.1"></a><p></p>
<h3>Potential Effects of Coadministration of Drugs Highly Bound to Plasma Proteins</h3>
<p class="First">Because sertraline is tightly bound to plasma protein, the administration of ZOLOFT (sertraline hydrochloride) to a patient taking another drug which is tightly bound to protein (e.g., warfarin, digitoxin) may cause a shift in plasma concentrations potentially resulting in an adverse effect. Conversely, adverse effects may result from displacement of protein bound ZOLOFT by other tightly bound drugs.</p>
<p>In a study comparing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4173906" conceptname="Clotting factor II assay">prothrombin</span> time AUC (0–120 hr) following dosing with warfarin (0.75 mg/kg) before and after 21 days of dosing with either ZOLOFT (50–200 mg/day) or placebo, there was a mean increase in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4173906" conceptname="Clotting factor II assay">prothrombin</span> time of 8% relative to baseline for ZOLOFT compared to a 1% decrease for placebo (p&lt;0.02). The normalization of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4173906" conceptname="Clotting factor II assay">prothrombin</span> time for the ZOLOFT group was delayed compared to the placebo group. The clinical significance of this change is unknown. Accordingly, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4173906" conceptname="Clotting factor II assay">prothrombin</span> time should be carefully monitored when ZOLOFT therapy is initiated or stopped.</p>

<h3>Cimetidine</h3>
<p class="First">In a study assessing disposition of ZOLOFT (100 mg) on the second of 8 days of cimetidine administration (800 mg daily), there were significant increases in ZOLOFT mean AUC (50%), Cmax (24%) and half-life (26%) compared to the placebo group. The clinical significance of these changes is unknown.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-6.6.3"></a><p></p>
<h3>CNS Active Drugs</h3>
<p class="First">In a study comparing the disposition of intravenously administered diazepam before and after 21 days of dosing with either ZOLOFT (50 to 200 mg/day escalating dose) or placebo, there was a 32% decrease relative to baseline in diazepam clearance for the ZOLOFT group compared to a 19% decrease relative to baseline for the placebo group (p&lt;0.03). There was a 23% increase in Tmax for desmethyldiazepam in the ZOLOFT group compared to a 20% decrease in the placebo group (p&lt;0.03). The clinical significance of these changes is unknown.</p>
<p>In a placebo-controlled trial in normal volunteers, the administration of two doses of ZOLOFT did not significantly alter steady-state lithium levels or the renal clearance of lithium.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, at this time, it is recommended that plasma lithium levels be monitored following initiation of ZOLOFT therapy with appropriate adjustments to the lithium dose.</p>
<p>In a controlled study of a single dose (2 mg) of pimozide, 200 mg sertraline (q.d.) co-administration to steady state was associated with a mean increase in pimozide AUC and Cmax of about 40%, but was not associated with any changes in EKG. Since the highest recommended pimozide dose (10 mg) has not been evaluated in combination with sertraline, the effect on QT interval and PK parameters at doses higher than 2 mg at this time are not known. While the mechanism of this interaction is unknown, due to the narrow therapeutic index of pimozide and due to the interaction noted at a low dose of pimozide, concomitant administration of ZOLOFT and pimozide should be contraindicated (see <a href="#Contraindications">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a>).</p>
<p>Results of a placebo-controlled trial in normal volunteers suggest that chronic administration of sertraline 200 mg/day does not produce clinically important inhibition of phenytoin metabolism.  Nonetheless, at this time, it is recommended that plasma phenytoin concentrations be monitored following initiation of ZOLOFT therapy with appropriate adjustments to the phenytoin dose, particularly in patients with multiple underlying medical conditions and/or those receiving multiple concomitant medications.</p>
<p>The effect of ZOLOFT on valproate levels has not been evaluated in clinical trials.  In the absence of such data, it is recommended that plasma valproate levels be monitored following initiation of ZOLOFT therapy with appropriate adjustments to the valproate dose.</p>
<p>The risk of using ZOLOFT in combination with other CNS active drugs has not been systematically evaluated. Consequently, caution is advised if the concomitant administration of ZOLOFT and such drugs is required.</p>
<p>There is limited controlled experience regarding the optimal timing of switching from other drugs effective in the treatment of major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span>, obsessive-compulsive disorder, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436074" conceptname="Panic disorder">panic disorder</span>, posttraumatic stress disorder, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242733" conceptname="Premenstrual dysphoric disorder">premenstrual dysphoric disorder</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440690" conceptname="Social phobia">social anxiety disorder</span> to ZOLOFT. Care and prudent medical judgment should be exercised when switching, particularly from long-acting agents. The duration of an appropriate washout period which should intervene before switching from one selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) to another has not been established.</p>

<h3>Drugs Metabolized by P450 3A4</h3>
<p class="First">In three separate <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> interaction studies, sertraline was co-administered with cytochrome P450 3A4 substrates, terfenadine, carbamazepine, or cisapride under steady-state conditions. The results of these studies indicated that sertraline did not increase plasma concentrations of terfenadine, carbamazepine, or cisapride. These data indicate that sertraline's extent of inhibition of P450 3A4 activity is not likely to be of clinical significance. Results of the interaction study with cisapride indicate that sertraline 200 mg (q.d.) induces the metabolism of cisapride (cisapride AUC and Cmax were reduced by about 35%).</p>

<h3>Drugs Metabolized by P450 2D6</h3>
<p class="First">Many drugs effective in the treatment of major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span>, e.g., the SSRIs, including sertraline, and most tricyclic antidepressant drugs effective in the treatment of major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> inhibit the biochemical activity of the drug metabolizing isozyme cytochrome P450 2D6 (debrisoquin hydroxylase), and, thus, may increase the plasma concentrations of co-administered drugs that are metabolized by P450 2D6. The drugs for which this potential interaction is of greatest concern are those metabolized primarily by 2D6 and which have a narrow therapeutic index, e.g., the tricyclic antidepressant drugs effective in the treatment of major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> and the Type 1C antiarrhythmics propafenone and flecainide. The extent to which this interaction is an important clinical problem depends on the extent of the inhibition of P450 2D6 by the antidepressant and the therapeutic index of the co-administered drug. There is variability among the drugs effective in the treatment of major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> in the extent of clinically important 2D6 inhibition, and in fact sertraline at lower doses has a less prominent inhibitory effect on 2D6 than some others in the class. Nevertheless, even sertraline has the potential for clinically important 2D6 inhibition. Consequently, concomitant use of a drug metabolized by P450 2D6 with ZOLOFT may require lower doses than usually prescribed for the other drug. Furthermore, whenever ZOLOFT is withdrawn from co-therapy, an increased dose of the co-administered drug may be required (see <a href="#Tricyclic_Antidepressant">Tricyclic Antidepressant Drugs Effective in the Treatment of Major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">Depressive Disorder</span> under PRECAUTIONS</a>).</p>

<h3>Tricyclic Antidepressant Drugs Effective in the Treatment of Major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">Depressive Disorder</span> (TCAs)</h3>
<p class="First">The extent to which SSRI–TCA interactions may pose clinical problems will depend on the degree of inhibition and the pharmacokinetics of the SSRI involved. Nevertheless, caution is indicated in the co-administration of TCAs with ZOLOFT, because sertraline may inhibit TCA metabolism. Plasma TCA concentrations may need to be monitored, and the dose of TCA may need to be reduced, if a TCA is co-administered with ZOLOFT (see <a href="#Drugs_Metabolized_P450_2D6">Drugs Metabolized by P450 2D6 under PRECAUTIONS</a>).</p>

<h3>Hypoglycemic Drugs</h3>
<p class="First">In a placebo-controlled trial in normal volunteers, administration of ZOLOFT for 22 days (including 200 mg/day for the final 13 days) caused a statistically significant 16% decrease from baseline in the clearance of tolbutamide following an intravenous 1000 mg dose. ZOLOFT administration did not noticeably change either the plasma protein binding or the apparent volume of distribution of tolbutamide, suggesting that the decreased clearance was due to a change in the metabolism of the drug. The clinical significance of this decrease in tolbutamide clearance is unknown.</p>

<h3>Microsomal Enzyme Induction</h3>
<p class="First">Preclinical studies have shown ZOLOFT to induce hepatic microsomal enzymes. In clinical studies, ZOLOFT was shown to induce hepatic enzymes minimally as determined by a small (5%) but statistically significant decrease in antipyrine half-life following administration of 200 mg/day for 21 days. This small change in antipyrine half-life reflects a clinically insignificant change in hepatic metabolism.</p>

<h2>Carcinogenesis</h2>
<p class="First">Lifetime carcinogenicity studies were carried out in CD-1 mice and Long-Evans rats at doses up to 40 mg/kg/day. These doses correspond to 1 times (mice) and 2 times (rats) the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. There was a dose-related increase of liver <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106411" conceptname="Adenofibroma">adenomas</span> in male mice receiving sertraline at 10–40 mg/kg (0.25–1.0 times the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis).

<h3>Pregnancy Category C</h3>
<p class="First">Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at doses up to 80 mg/kg/day and 40 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses correspond to approximately 4 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. There was no evidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4240324" conceptname="Teratogenesis">teratogenicity</span> at any dose level. When pregnant rats and rabbits were given sertraline during the period of organogenesis, delayed ossification was observed in fetuses at doses of 10 mg/kg (0.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) in rats and 40 mg/kg (4 times the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) in rabbits. When female rats received sertraline during the last third of gestation and throughout lactation, there was an increase in the number of stillborn pups and in the number of pups dying during the first 4 days after birth. Pup body weights were also decreased during the first four days after birth. These effects occurred at a dose of 20 mg/kg (1 times the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis). The no effect dose for rat pup mortality was 10 mg/kg (0.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis). The decrease in pup survival was shown to be due to <span class="Italics">in utero</span> exposure to sertraline. The clinical significance of these effects is unknown. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. ZOLOFT (sertraline hydrochloride) should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p>

<h3>Nonteratogenic Effects</h3>
<p class="First">Neonates exposed to ZOLOFT and other SSRIs or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), late in the third trimester have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding. Such complications can arise immediately upon delivery. Reported clinical findings have included <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4158346" conceptname="Respiratory distress">respiratory distress</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438555" conceptname="Cyanosis">cyanosis</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321689" conceptname="Apnea">apnea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizures</span>, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4002033" conceptname="Muscle relaxation">hypotonia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208994" conceptname="Increased muscle tone">hypertonia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4313132" conceptname="Hyperreflexia">hyperreflexia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443782" conceptname="Tremor">tremor</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436817" conceptname="Feeling nervous">jitteriness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4184149" conceptname="Feeling irritable">irritability</span>, and constant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4136768" conceptname="Crying">crying</span>. These features are consistent with either a direct toxic effect of SSRIs and SNRIs or, possibly, a drug discontinuation syndrome.

<p>Infants exposed to SSRIs in pregnancy may have an increased risk for persistent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4322024" conceptname="Pulmonary hypertension">pulmonary hypertension</span> of the newborn (PPHN). PPHN occurs in 1 – 2 per 1,000 live births in the general population and is associated with substantial neonatal morbidity and mortality.  Several recent epidemiologic studies suggest a positive statistical association between SSRI use (including ZOLOFT) in pregnancy and PPHN. Other studies do not show a significant statistical association.</p>
<p>Physicians should also note the results of a prospective longitudinal study of 201 pregnant women with a history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4114950" conceptname="Endogenous depression">major depression</span>, who were either on antidepressants or had received antidepressants less than 12 weeks prior to their last menstrual period, and were in remission.

<p>When treating a pregnant woman with ZOLOFT, the physician should carefully consider both the potential risks of taking an SSRI, along with the established benefits of treating <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> with an antidepressant.

<h2>Pediatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">The efficacy of ZOLOFT for the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder was demonstrated in a 12-week, multicenter, placebo-controlled study with 187 outpatients ages 6–17 (see <a href="#Clinical_Trials">Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a>). Safety and effectiveness in the pediatric population other than pediatric patients with OCD have not been established (see <a href="#Box_Warning">BOX WARNING</a> and <a href="#Clinical_Worsening">WARNINGS-Clinical Worsening and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">Suicide</span> Risk)</a>. Two placebo controlled trials (n=373) in pediatric patients with MDD have been conducted with ZOLOFT, and the data were not sufficient to support a claim for use in pediatric patients.  Anyone considering the use of ZOLOFT in a child or adolescent must balance the potential risks with the clinical need.</p>
<p>The safety of ZOLOFT use in children and adolescents with OCD, ages 6–18, was evaluated in a 12-week, multicenter, placebo-controlled study with 187 outpatients, ages 6–17, and in a flexible dose, 52 week open extension study of 137 patients, ages 6–18, who had completed the initial 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. ZOLOFT was administered at doses of either 25 mg/day (children, ages 6–12) or 50 mg/day (adolescents, ages 13–18) and then titrated in weekly 25 mg/day or 50 mg/day increments, respectively, to a maximum dose of 200 mg/day based upon clinical response. The mean dose for completers was 157 mg/day. In the acute 12 week pediatric study and in the 52 week study, ZOLOFT had an adverse event profile generally similar to that observed in adults.</p>
<p>Sertraline pharmacokinetics were evaluated in 61 pediatric patients between 6 and 17 years of age with major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> or OCD and revealed similar drug exposures to those of adults when plasma concentration was adjusted for weight (see <a href="#Pharmacokinetics">Pharmacokinetics under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a>).</p>
<p>Approximately 600 patients with major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> or OCD between 6 and 17 years of age have received ZOLOFT in clinical trials, both controlled and uncontrolled. The adverse event profile observed in these patients was generally similar to that observed in adult studies with ZOLOFT (see <a href="#Adverse_Reactions">ADVERSE REACTIONS</a>). As with other SSRIs, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442165" conceptname="Loss of appetite">decreased appetite</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134010" conceptname="Weight decreased">weight loss</span> have been observed in association with the use of ZOLOFT. In a pooled analysis of two 10-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, flexible dose (50–200 mg) outpatient trials for major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> (n=373), there was a difference in weight change between sertraline and placebo of roughly 1 kilogram, for both children (ages 6–11) and adolescents (ages 12–17), in both cases representing a slight <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134010" conceptname="Weight decreased">weight loss</span> for sertraline compared to a slight gain for placebo. At baseline the mean weight for children was 39.0 kg for sertraline and 38.5 kg for placebo. At baseline the mean weight for adolescents was 61.4 kg for sertraline and 62.5 kg for placebo. There was a bigger difference between sertraline and placebo in the proportion of outliers for clinically important <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134010" conceptname="Weight decreased">weight loss</span> in children than in adolescents. For children, about 7% had a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134010" conceptname="Weight decreased">weight loss</span> &gt; 7% of body weight compared to none of the placebo patients; for adolescents, about 2% had a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134010" conceptname="Weight decreased">weight loss</span> &gt; 7% of body weight compared to about 1% of the placebo patients. A subset of these patients who completed the randomized controlled trials (sertraline n=99, placebo n=122) were continued into a 24-week, flexible-dose, open-label, extension study. A mean <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134010" conceptname="Weight decreased">weight loss</span> of approximately 0.5 kg was seen during the first eight weeks of treatment for subjects with first exposure to sertraline during the open-label extension study, similar to mean <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134010" conceptname="Weight decreased">weight loss</span> observed among sertraline treated subjects during the first eight weeks of the randomized controlled trials. The subjects continuing in the open label study began gaining weight compared to baseline by week 12 of sertraline treatment. Those subjects who completed 34 weeks of sertraline treatment (10 weeks in a placebo controlled trial + 24 weeks open label, n=68) had <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134784" conceptname="Weight increased">weight gain</span> that was similar to that expected using data from age-adjusted peers. Regular monitoring of weight and growth is recommended if treatment of a pediatric patient with an SSRI is to be continued long term. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 6 have not been established.</p>
<p>The risks, if any, that may be associated with ZOLOFT's use beyond 1 year in children and adolescents with OCD or major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span> have not been systematically assessed. The prescriber should be mindful that the evidence relied upon to conclude that sertraline is safe for use in children and adolescents derives from clinical studies that were 10 to 52 weeks in duration and from the extrapolation of experience gained with adult patients. In particular, there are no studies that directly evaluate the effects of long-term sertraline use on the growth, development, and maturation of children and adolescents. Although there is no affirmative finding to suggest that sertraline possesses a capacity to adversely affect growth, development or maturation, the absence of such findings is not compelling evidence of the absence of the potential of sertraline to have adverse effects in chronic use (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#Clinical_Worsening">WARNINGS – Clinical Worsening and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440925" conceptname="Suicide">Suicide</span> Risk</a></span>).</p>

<h1>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h1>
<p class="First">During its premarketing assessment, multiple doses of ZOLOFT were administered to over 4000 adult subjects as of February 18, 2000. The conditions and duration of exposure to ZOLOFT varied greatly, and included (in overlapping categories) clinical pharmacology studies, open and double-blind studies, uncontrolled and controlled studies, inpatient and outpatient studies, fixed-dose and titration studies, and studies for multiple indications, including major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span>, OCD, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436074" conceptname="Panic disorder">panic disorder</span>, PTSD, PMDD and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440690" conceptname="Social phobia">social anxiety disorder</span>. </p>
<p>Untoward events associated with this exposure were recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Consequently, it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse events without first grouping similar types of untoward events into a smaller number of standardized event categories.</p>
<p>In the tabulations that follow, a World Health Organization dictionary of terminology has been used to classify reported adverse events. The frequencies presented, therefore, represent the proportion of the over 4000 adult individuals exposed to multiple doses of ZOLOFT who experienced a treatment-emergent adverse event of the type cited on at least one occasion while receiving ZOLOFT. An event was considered treatment-emergent if it occurred for the first time or worsened while receiving therapy following baseline evaluation. It is important to emphasize that events reported during therapy were not necessarily caused by it.</p>
<p>The prescriber should be aware that the figures in the tables and tabulations cannot be used to predict the incidence of side effects in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical trials. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, and investigators. The cited figures, however, do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and non-drug factors to the side effect incidence rate in the population studied.</p>

<h2>Male and Female <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4237140" conceptname="Abnormal sexual function">Sexual Dysfunction</span> with SSRIs</h2>
<p class="First">Although changes in sexual desire, sexual performance and sexual satisfaction often occur as manifestations of a psychiatric disorder, they may also be a consequence of pharmacologic treatment.  In particular, some evidence suggests that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can cause such untoward sexual experiences.  Reliable estimates of the incidence and severity of untoward experiences involving sexual desire, performance and satisfaction are difficult to obtain, however, in part because patients and physicians may be reluctant to discuss them.  Accordingly, estimates of the incidence of untoward sexual experience and performance cited in product labeling, are likely to underestimate their actual incidence.</p>
<p>Table 5 below displays the incidence of sexual side effects reported by at least 2% of patients taking ZOLOFT in placebo-controlled trials.</p>

<h2>Other Adverse Events in Pediatric Patients</h2>
<p class="First">In over 600 pediatric patients treated with ZOLOFT, the overall profile of adverse events was generally similar to that seen in adult studies. However, the following adverse events, from controlled trials, not appearing in Tables 2 and 3, were reported at an incidence of at least 2% and occurred at a rate of at least twice the placebo rate (N=281 patients treated with ZOLOFT): <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4195305" conceptname="Hyperactive behavior">hyperkinesia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="197672" conceptname="Urinary incontinence">urinary incontinence</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4021344" conceptname="Abusive behavior">aggressive reaction</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4283893" conceptname="Sinusitis">sinusitis</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318556" conceptname="Epistaxis">epistaxis</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4047773" conceptname="Purpura">purpura</span>.</p>

<h2>Other Events Observed During the Premarketing Evaluation of ZOLOFT (sertraline hydrochloride)</h2>
<p class="First">Following is a list of treatment-emergent adverse events reported during premarketing assessment of ZOLOFT in clinical trials (over 4000 adult subjects) except those already listed in the previous tables or elsewhere in labeling.</p>
<p>In the tabulations that follow, a World Health Organization dictionary of terminology has been used to classify reported adverse events. The frequencies presented, therefore, represent the proportion of the over 4000 adult individuals exposed to multiple doses of ZOLOFT who experienced an event of the type cited on at least one occasion while receiving ZOLOFT. All events are included except those already listed in the previous tables or elsewhere in labeling and those reported in terms so general as to be uninformative and those for which a causal relationship to ZOLOFT treatment seemed remote. It is important to emphasize that although the events reported occurred during treatment with ZOLOFT, they were not necessarily caused by it.</p>
<p>Events are further categorized by body system and listed in order of decreasing frequency according to the following definitions: frequent adverse events are those occurring on one or more occasions in at least 1/100 patients; infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients; rare events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1000 patients. Events of major clinical importance are also described in the PRECAUTIONS section.</p>

<h2>Physical and Psychological <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">Dependence</span></h2>
<p class="First">In a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized study of the comparative abuse liability of ZOLOFT, alprazolam, and d-amphetamine in humans, ZOLOFT did not produce the positive subjective effects indicative of abuse potential, such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4142453" conceptname="Feeling high">euphoria</span> or drug liking, that were observed with the other two drugs. Premarketing clinical experience with ZOLOFT did not reveal any tendency for a withdrawal syndrome or any drug-seeking behavior. In animal studies ZOLOFT does not demonstrate stimulant or barbiturate-like (depressant) abuse potential. As with any CNS active drug, however, physicians should carefully evaluate patients for history of drug abuse and follow such patients closely, observing them for signs of ZOLOFT misuse or abuse (e.g., development of tolerance, incrementation of dose, drug-seeking behavior).</p>

<p class="First">Of 1,027 cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> involving sertraline hydrochloride worldwide, alone or with other drugs, there were 72 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> (circa 1999).</p>
<p>Among 634 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdoses</span> in which sertraline hydrochloride was the only drug ingested, 8 resulted in fatal outcome, 75 completely recovered, and 27 patients experienced sequelae after overdosage to include <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="133280" conceptname="Alopecia">alopecia</span>, decreased libido, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4297368" conceptname="Abnormal ejaculation">ejaculation disorder</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223659" conceptname="Fatigue">fatigue</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4154707" conceptname="Serotonin syndrome">serotonin syndrome</span>. The remaining 524 cases had an unknown outcome. The most common signs and symptoms associated with non-fatal sertraline hydrochloride overdosage were <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">tachycardia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">agitation</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443782" conceptname="Tremor">tremor</span>.</p>
<p>The largest known ingestion was 13.5 grams in a patient who took sertraline hydrochloride alone and subsequently recovered. However, another patient who took 2.5 grams of sertraline hydrochloride alone experienced a fatal outcome.</p>

<h2><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">Overdose</span> Management</h2>
<p class="First">Treatment should consist of those general measures employed in the management of overdosage with any antidepressant.</p>
<p>Ensure an adequate airway, oxygenation and ventilation.  Monitor cardiac rhythm and vital signs. General supportive and symptomatic measures are also recommended. Induction of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">emesis</span> is not recommended. Gastric lavage with a large-bore orogastric tube with appropriate airway protection, if needed, may be indicated if performed soon after ingestion, or in symptomatic patients.</p>
<p>Activated charcoal should be administered. Due to large volume of distribution of this drug, forced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="79936" conceptname="Polyuria">diuresis</span>, dialysis, hemoperfusion and exchange transfusion are unlikely to be of benefit. No specific antidotes for sertraline are known.</p>
<p>In managing overdosage, consider the possibility of multiple drug involvement. The physician should consider contacting a poison control center on the treatment of any <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>. Telephone numbers for certified poison control centers are listed in the <span class="Italics">Physicians' Desk Reference<span class="Sup">®</span></span> (PDR<span class="Sup">®</span>).</p>

<p class="First">ZOLOFT treatment should be initiated with a dose of 25 mg once daily. After one week, the dose should be increased to 50 mg once daily.</p>
<p>While a relationship between dose and effect has not been established for major <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depressive disorder</span>, OCD, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436074" conceptname="Panic disorder">panic disorder</span>, PTSD or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440690" conceptname="Social phobia">social anxiety disorder</span>, patients were dosed in a range of 50–200 mg/day in the clinical trials demonstrating the effectiveness of ZOLOFT for the treatment of these indications. Consequently, a dose of 50 mg, administered once daily, is recommended as the initial therapeutic dose. Patients not responding to a 50 mg dose may benefit from dose increases up to a maximum of 200 mg/day. Given the 24 hour elimination half-life of ZOLOFT, dose changes should not occur at intervals of less than 1 week.</p>

<h4><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242733" conceptname="Premenstrual dysphoric disorder">Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder</span></h4>
<p class="First">ZOLOFT treatment should be initiated with a dose of 50 mg/day, either daily throughout the menstrual cycle or limited to the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, depending on physician assessment.</p>
<p>While a relationship between dose and effect has not been established for PMDD, patients were dosed in the range of 50–150 mg/day with dose increases at the onset of each new menstrual cycle (see <a href="#Clinical_Trials">Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a>). Patients not responding to a 50 mg/day dose may benefit from dose increases (at 50 mg increments/menstrual cycle) up to 150 mg/day when dosing daily throughout the menstrual cycle, or 100 mg/day when dosing during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle.  If a 100 mg/day dose has been established with luteal phase dosing, a 50 mg/day titration step for three days should be utilized at the beginning of each luteal phase dosing period.</p>
<p>ZOLOFT should be administered once daily, either in the morning or evening.</p>

<p>While a relationship between dose and effect has not been established for OCD, patients were dosed in a range of 25–200 mg/day in the clinical trials demonstrating the effectiveness of ZOLOFT for pediatric patients (6–17 years) with OCD. Patients not responding to an initial dose of 25 or 50 mg/day may benefit from dose increases up to a maximum of 200 mg/day. For children with OCD, their generally lower body weights compared to adults should be taken into consideration in advancing the dose, in order to avoid excess dosing.

<p class="First">It is generally agreed that OCD and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436074" conceptname="Panic disorder">Panic Disorder</span> require several months or longer of sustained pharmacological therapy beyond response to initial treatment. Systematic evaluation of continuing ZOLOFT for periods of up to 28 weeks in patients with OCD and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436074" conceptname="Panic disorder">Panic Disorder</span> who have responded while taking ZOLOFT during initial treatment phases of 24 to 52 weeks of treatment at a dose range of 50–200 mg/day has demonstrated a benefit of such maintenance treatment (see <a href="#Clinical_Trials">Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a>).

<p class="First">The effectiveness of ZOLOFT in long-term use, that is, for more than 3 menstrual cycles, has not been systematically evaluated in controlled trials. However, as women commonly report that symptoms worsen with age until relieved by the onset of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4059477" conceptname="Menopause">menopause</span>, it is reasonable to consider continuation of a responding patient. Dosage adjustments, which may include changes between dosage regimens (e.g., daily throughout the menstrual cycle versus during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle), may be needed to maintain the patient on the lowest effective dosage and patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for continued treatment.</p>

<a name="section-10.1.3.6"></a><p></p>
<h4>Switching a Patient To or From a Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor (MAOI) Intended to Treat Psychiatric Disorders</h4>
<p class="First">At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders and initiation of therapy with ZOLOFT. Conversely, at least 14 days should be allowed after stopping ZOLOFT before starting an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders (see <a href="#Contraindications">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a>).</p>

<h4>Use of ZOLOFT With Other MAOIs Such as Linezolid or Methylene Blue</h4>
<p class="First">Do not start ZOLOFT in a patient who is being treated with linezolid or intravenous methylene blue because there is increased risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4154707" conceptname="Serotonin syndrome">serotonin syndrome</span>. In a patient who requires more urgent treatment of a psychiatric condition, other interventions, including hospitalization, should be considered (see <a href="#Contraindications">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a>).</p>
<p>In some cases, a patient already receiving ZOLOFT therapy may require urgent treatment with linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. If acceptable alternatives to linezolid or intravenous methylene blue treatment are not available and the potential benefits of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue treatment are judged to outweigh the risks of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4154707" conceptname="Serotonin syndrome">serotonin syndrome</span> in a particular patient, ZOLOFT should be stopped promptly, and linezolid or intravenous methylene blue can be administered. The patient should be monitored for symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4154707" conceptname="Serotonin syndrome">serotonin syndrome</span> for 2 weeks or until 24 hours after the last dose of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue, whichever comes first. Therapy with ZOLOFT may be resumed 24 hours after the last dose of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue (see <a href="#warnings">WARNINGS</a>).</p>
<p>The risk of administering methylene blue by non-intravenous routes (such as oral tablets or by local injection) or in intravenous doses much lower than 1 mg/kg with ZOLOFT is unclear. The clinician should, nevertheless, be aware of the possibility of emergent symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4154707" conceptname="Serotonin syndrome">serotonin syndrome</span> with such use (see <a href="#warnings">WARNINGS</a>).</p>

<h4>Dosage for Hepatically Impaired Patients</h4>
<p class="First">The use of sertraline in patients with liver disease should be approached with caution. The effects of sertraline in patients with moderate and severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">hepatic impairment</span> have not been studied.

<h3>Discontinuation of Treatment with ZOLOFT</h3>
<p class="First">Symptoms associated with discontinuation of ZOLOFT and other SSRIs and SNRIs, have been reported (see <a href="#Precautions">PRECAUTIONS</a>). Patients should be monitored for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment. A gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate.</p>

<h3>ZOLOFT Oral Concentrate</h3>
<p class="First">ZOLOFT Oral Concentrate contains 20 mg/mL of sertraline (as the hydrochloride) as the active ingredient and 12% alcohol. ZOLOFT Oral Concentrate must be diluted before use. Just before taking, use the dropper provided to remove the required amount of ZOLOFT Oral Concentrate and mix with 4 oz (1/2 cup) of water, ginger ale, lemon/lime soda, lemonade or orange juice ONLY. Do not mix ZOLOFT Oral Concentrate with anything other than the liquids listed. The dose should be taken immediately after mixing. Do not mix in advance. At times, a slight haze may appear after mixing; this is normal. Note that caution should be exercised for patients with latex sensitivity, as the dropper dispenser contains dry natural rubber.</p>
<p>ZOLOFT Oral Concentrate is contraindicated with ANTABUSE (disulfiram) due to the alcohol content of the concentrate.</p>
