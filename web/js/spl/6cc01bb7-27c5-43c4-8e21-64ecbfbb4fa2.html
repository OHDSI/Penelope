<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Codeine:</span> Codeine probably exerts its antitussive activity by depressing the medullary (brain) <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="254761" conceptname="Cough">cough</span> center, thereby raising its threshold for incoming <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="254761" conceptname="Cough">cough</span> impulses.</p>
<p>Codeine is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, with a therapeutic dose reaching peak antitussive effectiveness in about 2 hours and persisting for 4 to 6 hours. Codeine is rapidly distributed from blood to body tissues and taken up preferentially by parenchymatous organs such as liver, spleen and kidney. It passes the blood brain barrier and is found in fetal tissue and breast milk.</p>
<p>The drug is not bound by plasma proteins nor is it accumulated in body tissues. Codeine is metabolized in the liver to morphine and norcodeine, each representing about 10 percent of the administered codeine dose. About 90 percent of the dose is excreted within 24 hours, primarily through the kidneys. Urinary excretion products are free and glucuronide-conjugated codeine (about 70%), free and conjugated norcodeine (about 10%), free and conjugated morphine (about 10%), normorphine (under 4%) and hydrocodone (&lt;1%). The remainder of the dose appears in the feces.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Triprolidine:</span> Antihistamines such as triprolidine hydrochloride act as antagonists of the H1 histamine receptor. Consequently, they prevent histamine from eliciting typical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223759" conceptname="IgE-mediated allergic disorder">immediate hypersensitivity</span> responses in the nose, eyes, lungs and skin.</p>
<p>Animal distribution studies have shown localization of triprolidine in lung, spleen and kidney tissue. Liver microsome studies have revealed the presence of several metabolites with an oxidized product of the toluene methyl group predominating.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Pseudoephedrine:</span> Pseudoephedrine acts as an indirect sympathomimetic agent by stimulating sympathetic (adrenergic) nerve endings to release norepinephrine. Norepinephrine in turn stimulates alpha and beta receptors throughout the body. The action of pseudoephedrine hydrochloride is apparently more specific for the blood vessels of the upper respiratory tract and less specific for the blood vessels of the systemic circulation. The <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4137788" conceptname="Vascular constriction">vasoconstriction</span> elicited at these sites results in the shrinkage of swollen tissues in the sinuses and nasal passages.</p>
<p>Pseudoephedrine is rapidly and almost completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Considerable variation in half-life has been observed (from about 4Â½ to 10 hours), which is attributed to individual differences in absorption and excretion. Excretion rates are also altered by urine pH, increasing with acidification and decreasing with alkalinization. As a result, mean half-life <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">falls</span> to about 4 hours at pH 5 and increases to 12 to 13 hours at pH 8.</p>
<p>After administration of a 60 mg tablet, 87 to 96% of the pseudoephedrine is cleared from the body within 24 hours. The drug is distributed to body tissues and fluids, including fetal tissue, breast milk and the central nervous system (CNS). About 55 to 75% of an administered dose is excreted unchanged in the urine; the remainder is apparently metabolized in the liver to inactive compounds by N-demethylation, parahydroxylation and oxidative deamination.</p>

<h1><span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span></h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">General</span>: Triacin-C should be prescribed with caution for certain special-risk patients, such as the elderly or debilitated, and for those with severe impairment of renal or hepatic function, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192353" conceptname="Disorder of gallbladder">gallbladder disease</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="196456" conceptname="Gallstone">gallstones</span>, respiratory impairment, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">cardiac arrhythmias</span>, history of bronchial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198803" conceptname="Benign prostatic hyperplasia">prostatic hypertrophy</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="195590" conceptname="Urethral stricture">urethral stricture</span>, and in patients known to be taking other antitussive, antihistamine or decongestant medications. Patientsâ€™ self-medication habits should be investigated to determine their use of such medications. Triacin-C is intended for short-term use only.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Information For Patients</span>:<br>Advise patients that some people have a genetic variation that results in codeine changing into morphine more rapidly and completely than other people. Most people are unaware of whether they are an ultra-rapid codeine metabolizer or not.

<p><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment Of Fertility</span>: No adequate studies have been conducted in animals to determine whether the components of Triacin-C have a potential for carcinogenesis, mutagenesis or impairment of fertility.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Pregnancy</span>: Teratogenic Effects â€“ Pregnancy category C. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Triacin-C. It is also not known whether this product can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. This product should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.</p>
<p>Teratology studies have been conducted with the three ingredients of Triacin-C. Pseudoephedrine studies were conducted in rats at doses up to 150 times the human dose; triprolidine was studied in rats and rabbits at doses up to 125 times the human dose, and codeine studies were conducted in rats and rabbits at doses up to 150 times the human dose. No evidence of teratogenic harm to the fetus was revealed in any of these studies. However, overt signs of toxicity were observed in the dams which received pseudoephedrine. This was reflected in reduced average weight and length and rate of skeletal ossification in their fetuses.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Nursing Mothers:</span> The components of Triacin-C are excreted in breast milk in small amounts, but the significance of their effects on nursing infants is not known. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from maternal ingestion of this product, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.

Data are not available for other ethnic groups. These individuals convert codeine into its active metabolite, morphine, more rapidly and completely than other people. This rapid conversion results in higher than expected serum morphine levels. Even at labeled dosage regimens, individuals who are ultra-rapid metabolizers may have life-threatening or fatal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> or experience signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> (such as extreme <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">sleepiness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381273" conceptname="Confusional state">confusion</span>, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4302536" conceptname="Shallow breathing">shallow breathing</span>) (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#L464ccb1d-a03b-4954-81b5-d5021dbdf603">OVERDOSAGE</a>).</span></p>

<p class="First">Like other medications containing a narcotic, Triacin-C is controlled by the Drug Enforcement Administration. It is classified under Schedule V.</p>
<p>Codeine can produce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440069" conceptname="Drug dependence">drug dependence</span> of the morphine type, and therefore it has a potential for being abused.

<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<p class="First">Since Triacin-C is comprised of three pharmacologically different compounds, it is difficult to predict the exact manifestation of symptoms in a given individual. Reaction to an overdosage of this product may vary from <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4171908" conceptname="Semicoma">CNS depression</span> to stimulation. A detailed description of symptoms which are likely to appear after ingestion of an excess of the individual components follows:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Overdosage with codeine can cause transient <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4142453" conceptname="Feeling high">euphoria</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>, weariness, diminution of sensitivity, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4141128" conceptname="Absence of sensation">loss of sensation</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, transient <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">excitement</span> in children, and occasionally in adult women, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435279" conceptname="Tonic pupillary reaction">miosis</span> progressing to nonreactive pinpoint pupils, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4302654" conceptname="Itching">itching</span> sometimes with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">skin rashes</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="139900" conceptname="Urticaria">urticaria</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4308436" conceptname="Cold sweat">clammy</span> skin with mottled <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438555" conceptname="Cyanosis">cyanosis</span>. In more severe cases, muscular relaxation with depressed or absent superficial and deep reflexes and a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4079173" conceptname="Extensor plantar response">positive Babinski</span> sign may appear. Marked slowing of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4313591" conceptname="Respiratory rate">respiratory rate</span> with inadequate pulmonary ventilation and consequent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438555" conceptname="Cyanosis">cyanosis</span> may occur.

<p></p>
<p>Overdosage with triprolidine may produce reactions varying from <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> to stimulation of the Central Nervous System (CNS); the latter is particularly likely in children. Atropine-like signs and symptoms (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4226991" conceptname="Aptyalism">dry mouth</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4011326" conceptname="Fixed dilatation of pupil">fixed dilated pupils</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318566" conceptname="Flushing">flushing</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">tachycardia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433031" conceptname="Hallucinations">hallucinations</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192450" conceptname="Retention of urine">urinary retention</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">cardiac arrhythmias</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380834" conceptname="Coma">coma</span>) may occur.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Overdosage with pseudoephedrine can cause excessive CNS stimulation resulting in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436087" conceptname="Excitement">excitement</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436817" conceptname="Feeling nervous">nervousness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441542" conceptname="Anxiety">anxiety</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443782" conceptname="Tremor">tremor</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4012381" conceptname="Restlessness">restlessness</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436962" conceptname="Insomnia">insomnia</span>. Other effects include <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">tachycardia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4260836" conceptname="Blanching of skin">pallor</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4290615" conceptname="Dilated pupil">mydriasis</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214376" conceptname="Hyperglycemia">hyperglycemia</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192450" conceptname="Retention of urine">urinary retention</span>.

Severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437833" conceptname="Hypokalemia">hypokalemia</span> can occur, probably due to compartmental shift rather than depletion of potassium. No organ damage or significant metabolic derangement is associated with pseudoephedrine overdosage.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The toxic plasma concentration of codeine is not known with certainty. Experimental production of mild to moderate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4171908" conceptname="Semicoma">CNS depression</span> in healthy, nontolerant subjects occurs at plasma concentrations of 0.5-1.9Âµg/mL when codeine is given by intravenous infusion. The single lethal dose of codeine in adults is estimated to be from 0.5 to 1.0 gram. It is also estimated that 5 mg/kg could be fatal in children.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The LD<span class="Sub">50</span> (single, oral dose) of triprolidine is 163 to 308 mg/kg in the mouse (depending upon <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strain</span>) and 840 mg/kg in the rat.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Insufficient data are available to estimate the toxic and lethal doses of triprolidine in humans. No reports of acute <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">poisoning</span> with triprolidine have appeared.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The LD<span class="Sub">50</span> (single, oral dose) of pseudoephedrine is 726 mg/kg in the mouse, 2206 mg/kg in the rat and 1177 mg/kg in the rabbit. The toxic and lethal concentrations in human biologic fluids are not known. Excretion rates increase with urine acidification and decrease with alkalinization. Few reports of toxicity due to pseudoephedrine have been published and no case of fatal overdosage is known.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Therapy, if instituted within 4 hours of overdosage, is aimed at reducing further absorption of the drug. In the conscious patient, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span> should be induced even though it may have occurred spontaneously. If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span> cannot be induced, gastric lavage is indicated. Adequate precautions must be taken to protect against <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4239038" conceptname="Pulmonary aspiration">aspiration</span>, especially in infants and children. Charcoal slurry or other suitable agents should be instilled into the stomach after <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span> or lavage. Saline cathartics or milk of magnesia may be of additional benefit.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="372448" conceptname="Loss of consciousness">unconscious</span> patient, the airway should be secured with a cuffed endotracheal tube before attempting to evacuate the gastric contents. Intensive supportive and nursing care is indicated, as for any <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380834" conceptname="Coma">comatose</span> patient.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If breathing is significantly impaired, maintenance of an adequate airway and mechanical support of respiration is the most effective means of providing adequate oxygenation.</p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">Hypotension</span> is an early sign of impending <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443240" conceptname="Collapse">cardiovascular collapse</span> and should be treated vigorously. Do not use CNS stimulants. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">Convulsions</span> should be controlled by careful administration of diazepam or short-acting barbiturate, repeated as necessary. Physostigmine may be also considered for use in controlling centrally mediated <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Ice packs and cooling sponge baths, not alcohol, can aid in reducing the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span> commonly seen in children.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For codeine, continuous stimulation that arouses, but does not exhaust, the patient is useful in preventing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="380834" conceptname="Coma">coma</span>. Continuous or intermittent oxygen therapy is usually indicated, while naloxone is useful as a codeine antidote. Close nursing care is essential.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Saline cathartics, such as milk of magnesia, help to dilute the concentration of the drugs in the bowel by drawing water into the gut, thereby hastening drug elimination.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Adrenergic receptor blocking agents are antidotes to pseudoephedrine. In practice, the most useful is the beta-blocker propranolol, which is indicated when there are signs of cardiac toxicity.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There are no specific antidotes to triprolidine. Histamine should not be given.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Pseudoephedrine and codeine are theoretically dialyzable, but the procedures have not been clinically established.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In severe cases of overdosage, it is essential to monitor both the heart (by electrocardiograph) and plasma electrolytes and to give intravenous potassium as indicated by these continuous controls. Vasopressors may be used to treat <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, and excessive CNS stimulation may be counteracted with parenteral diazepam. Stimulants should not be used.</p>
