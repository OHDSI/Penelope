<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">There is evidence that the metabolism of fluorouracil in the anabolic pathway blocks the methylation reaction of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid. In this manner, fluorouracil interferes with the synthesis of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and to a lesser extent inhibits the formation of ribonucleic acid (RNA). Since DNA and RNA are essential for cell division and growth, the effect of fluorouracil may be to create a thymine deficiency that provokes unbalanced growth and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> of the cell. The effects of DNA and RNA deprivation are most marked on those cells that grow more rapidly and take up fluorouracil at a more rapid rate. The contribution to efficacy or safety of individual components of the vehicle has not been established.</p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics: </h2>
<p class="First">A multiple-dose, randomized, open-label, parallel study was performed in 21 patients with actinic keratoses. Twenty patients had pharmacokinetic samples collected: 10 patients treated with Fluorouracil Cream USP, 0.5% (Microsphere) and 10 treated with Fluorouracil Cream, 5%. Patients were treated for a maximum of 28 days with Fluorouracil Cream USP, 0.5% (Microsphere), 1 g once daily in the morning; or Fluorouracil Cream, 5%, 1 g twice daily, in the morning and evening. Steady-state plasma concentrations and the amounts of fluorouracil in urine resulting from the topical application of either product were measured. Three patients who receivedÂ Fluorouracil Cream USP, 0.5% (Microsphere) and nine patients who received Fluorouracil Cream, 5% had measurable plasma fluorouracil levels; however, only one patient receiving Fluorouracil Cream USP, 0.5% (Microsphere) and six patients receiving Fluorouracil Cream, 5% had a sufficient number of data points to calculate mean pharmacokinetic parameters.</p>

<h2>Clinical Trials:</h2>
<p class="First">Under the experimental conditions of the topical safety studies,Â Fluorouracil Cream USP, 0.5% (Microsphere) was not observed to cause contact sensitization. However, approximately 95% of subjects in the active arms of the Phase 3 clinical studies experienced facial irritation. Irritation is likely and sensitization is unlikely based on the results of the topical safety and Phase 3 studies.</p>
<p>Two Phase 3 identically designed, multi-center, vehicle-controlled, double-blind studies were conducted to evaluate the clinical safety and efficacy of Fluorouracil Cream USP, 0.5% (Microsphere). Patients with 5 or more actinic keratoses (AKs) on the face or anterior bald scalp were randomly allocated to active or vehicle treatment in a 2:1 ratio. Patients were randomly allocated to treatment durations of 1, 2, or 4 weeks in a 1:1:1 ratio. They applied the study cream once daily to the entire face/anterior bald scalp. Each patientâ€™s clinical response was evaluated 4 weeks after the patientâ€™s last scheduled application of study cream. No additional post-treatment follow-up efficacy or safety assessments were performed beyond 4 weeks after the last scheduled application. The following graphs show the percentage of patients in whom 100% of treated lesions cleared, and the percentage of patients in whom 75% or more of treated lesions cleared. Treatment withÂ Fluorouracil Cream USP, 0.5% (Microsphere) for 1, 2, or 4 weeks is compared to treatment with vehicle cream. Outcomes from 1, 2, and 4 weeks of treatment with vehicle cream are pooled because duration of treatment with vehicle had no substantive effect on clearance. Results from the two Phase 3 studies are shown separately. Although all treatment regimens ofÂ Fluorouracil Cream USP, 0.5% (Microsphere) studied demonstrated efficacy over vehicle for the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138825" conceptname="Actinic keratosis">actinic keratosis</span>, continuing treatment up to 4 weeks as tolerated results in further lesion reduction and clearing.</p>

<h1>INDICATIONS AND USAGE</h1>
<p class="First">Fluorouracil Cream USP, 0.5% (Microsphere) is indicated for the topical treatment of multiple actinic or solar keratoses of the face and anterior scalp.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34070-3">
<a name="Section_4"></a><a name="section-5"></a><p></p>
<h1>CONTRAINDICATIONS</h1>
<p class="First">Fluorouracil may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Fluorouracil is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.</p>
<p>No adequate and well-controlled studies have been conducted in pregnant women with either topical or parenteral forms of fluorouracil. One birth defect (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434462" conceptname="Ventricular septal defect">ventricular septal defect</span>) and cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4067106" conceptname="Miscarriage">miscarriage</span> have been reported when fluorouracil was applied to mucous membrane areas. Multiple <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4029540" conceptname="Congenital anomaly">birth defects</span> have been reported in the fetus of a patient treated with intravenous fluorouracil.</p>
<p>Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Fluorouracil Cream USP, 0.5% (Microsphere). Fluorouracil, the active ingredient, has been shown to be teratogenic in mice, rats, and hamsters when administered parenterally at doses greater than or equal to 10, 15 and 33 mg/kg/day, respectively, [4X, 11X and 20X, respectively, the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) based on body surface area (BSA)]. Fluorouracil was administered during the period of organogenesis for each species. Embryolethal effects occurred in monkeys at parenteral doses greater than 40 mg/kg/day (65X the MRHD based on BSA) administered during the period of organogenesis.</p>
<p>Fluorouracil Cream USP, 0.5% (Microsphere) should not be used in patients with dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) enzyme deficiency. A large percentage of fluorouracil is catabolized by the enzyme dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD). DPD enzyme deficiency can result in shunting of fluorouracil to the anabolic pathway, leading to cytotoxic activity and potential toxicities.</p>
<p>Fluorouracil Cream USP, 0.5% (Microsphere)Â is contraindicated in patients with known <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity</span> to any of its components.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34071-1">

<h1>WARNINGS</h1>
<p class="First">The potential for a delayed <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity reaction</span> to fluorouracil exists. Patch testing to prove <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity</span> may be inconclusive.</p>
<p>Patients should discontinue therapy with Fluorouracil Cream USP, 0.5% (Microsphere) if symptoms of DPD enzyme deficiency develop.</p>
<p>Rarely, unexpected, systemic toxicity (e.g. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138455" conceptname="Stomatitis">stomatitis</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="320073" conceptname="Neutropenia">neutropenia</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4024301" conceptname="Neurotoxicity">neurotoxicity</span>) associated with parental administration of fluorouracil has been attributed to deficiency of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase â€œDPDâ€? activity. One case of life threatening systemic toxicity has been reported with the topical use of 5% fluorouracil in a patient with a complete absence of DPD enzyme activity.

<h2>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility</h2>
<p class="First">Adequate long-term studies in animals to evaluate carcinogenic potential have not been conducted with fluorouracil. Studies with the active ingredient of Fluorouracil Cream USP, 0.5% (Microsphere), fluorouracil, have shown positive effects in <span class="Italics">in vitro </span>and <span class="Italics">in vivo </span>tests for mutagenicity and on impairment of fertility in <span class="Italics">in vivo </span>animal studies.</p>
<p>Fluorouracil produced morphological transformation of cells in <span class="Italics">in vitro </span>cell transformation assays. Morphological transformation was also produced in an <span class="Italics">in vitro </span>assay by a metabolite of fluorouracil, and the transformed cells produced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="197506" conceptname="Malignant neoplasm of abdomen">malignant tumors</span> when injected into immunosuppressed syngeneic mice. Fluorouracil has been shown to exert mutagenic activity in yeast cells, <span class="Italics">Bacillus subtilis, </span>and <span class="Italics">Drosophila </span>assays. In addition, fluorouracil has produced chromosome damage at concentrations of 1.0 and 2.0 mcg/mL in an <span class="Italics">in vitro </span>hamster fibroblast assay, was positive in a microwell mouse <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432571" conceptname="Malignant lymphoma">lymphoma</span> assay, and was positive in <span class="Italics">in vivo </span>micronucleus assays in rats and mice following intraperitoneal administration. Some patients receiving cumulative doses of 0.24 to 1.0 g of fluorouracil parenterally have shown an increase in numerical and structural chromosome aberrations in peripheral blood <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4254663" conceptname="Lymphocyte count">lymphocytes</span>.</p>
<p>Fluorouracil has been shown to impair fertility after parenteral administration in rats. Fluorouracil administered at intraperitoneal doses of 125 and 250 mg/kg has been shown to induce chromosomal aberrations and changes in chromosome organization of spermatogonia in rats. In mice, single-dose intravenous and intraperitoneal injections of fluorouracil have been reported to kill differentiated spermatogonia and spermatocytes at a dose of 500 mg/kg and produce abnormalities in spermatids at 50 mg/kg.</p>
