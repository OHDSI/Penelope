<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> (aprotinin injection), C<span class="Sub">284</span>H<span class="Sub">432</span>N<span class="Sub">84</span>O<span class="Sub">79</span>S<span class="Sub">7</span>, is a natural proteinase inhibitor obtained from bovine lung. Aprotinin (molecular weight of 6512 daltons), consists of 58 amino acid residues that are arranged in a single polypeptide chain, cross-linked by three disulfide bridges. It is supplied as a clear, colorless, sterile isotonic solution for intravenous administration. Each milliliter contains 10,000 KIU (Kallikrein Inhibitor Units) (1.4 mg/mL) and 9 mg sodium chloride in water for injection. Hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide is used to adjust the pH to 4.5-6.5.</p>

<h2>Mechanism of Action:</h2>
<p class="First">Aprotinin is a broad spectrum protease inhibitor which modulates the systemic inflammatory response (SIR) associated with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) surgery. SIR results in the interrelated activation of the hemostatic, fibrinolytic, cellular and humoral inflammatory systems. Aprotinin, through its inhibition of multiple mediators [e.g., kallikrein, plasmin] results in the attenuation of inflammatory responses, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4299457" conceptname="Fibrinolysis">fibrinolysis</span>, and thrombin generation.</p>
<p>Aprotinin inhibits pro-inflammatory cytokine release and maintains glycoprotein homeostasis. In platelets, aprotinin reduces glycoprotein loss (e.g., GpIb, GpIIb/IIIa), while in granulocytes it prevents the expression of pro-inflammatory adhesive glycoproteins (e.g., CD11b).</p>
<p>The effects of aprotinin use in CPB involves a reduction in inflammatory response which translates into a decreased need for allogeneic blood transfusions, reduced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>, and decreased mediastinal re-exploration for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="43682-4">
<a name="s3.2"></a><a name="section-3.2"></a><p></p>
<h2>Pharmacokinetics:</h2>
<p class="First">The studies comparing the pharmacokinetics of aprotinin in healthy volunteers, cardiac patients undergoing surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass, and women undergoing hysterectomy suggest linear pharmacokinetics over the dose range of 50,000 KIU to 2 million KIU. After intravenous (IV) injection, rapid distribution of aprotinin occurs into the total extracellular space, leading to a rapid initial decrease in plasma aprotinin concentration. Following this distribution phase, a plasma half-life of about 150 minutes is observed. At later time points, (i.e., beyond 5 hours after dosing) there is a terminal elimination phase with a half-life of about 10 hours.</p>
<p>Average steady state intraoperative plasma concentrations were 137 KIU/mL (n=10) after administration of the following dosage regimen: 1 million KIU IV loading dose, 1 million KIU into the pump prime volume, 250,000 KIU per hour of operation as continuous intravenous infusion (Regimen B). Average steady state intraoperative plasma concentrations were 250 KIU/mL in patients (n=20) treated with aprotinin during cardiac surgery by administration of Regimen A (exactly double Regimen B): 2 million KIU IV loading dose, 2 million KIU into the pump prime volume, 500,000 KIU per hour of operation as continuous intravenous infusion.</p>
<p>Following a single IV dose of radiolabelled aprotinin, approximately 25-40% of the radioactivity is excreted in the urine over 48 hours. After a 30 minute infusion of 1 million KIU, about 2% is excreted as unchanged drug. After a larger dose of 2 million KIU infused over 30 minutes, urinary excretion of unchanged aprotinin accounts for approximately 9% of the dose. Animal studies have shown that aprotinin is accumulated primarily in the kidney. Aprotinin, after being filtered by the glomeruli, is actively reabsorbed by the proximal tubules in which it is stored in phagolysosomes. Aprotinin is slowly degraded by lysosomal enzymes. The physiological renal handling of aprotinin is similar to that of other small proteins, e.g., insulin.</p>

<h2>Repeat Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Patients:</h2>
<p class="First">Four placebo-controlled, double-blind studies of Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> were conducted in the United States; of 540 randomized patients undergoing repeat coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, 480 were valid for efficacy analysis. The following treatment regimens were used in the studies:</p>
<p>Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> Regimen A (2 million KIU IV loading dose, 2 million KIU into the pump prime volume, and 500,000 KIU per hour of surgery as a continuous intravenous infusion); Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> Regimen B (1 million KIU IV loading dose, 1 million KIU into the pump prime volume, and 250,000 KIU per hour of surgery as a continuous intravenous infusion); a pump prime regimen (2 million KIU into the pump prime volume only); and a placebo regimen (normal saline). All patients valid for efficacy in the above studies were pooled by treatment regimen for analyses of efficacy.</p>
<p>In this pooled analysis, fewer patients receiving Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span>, either Regimen A or Regimen B, required any donor blood compared to the pump prime only or placebo regimens. The number of units of donor blood required by patients, the volume (milliliters) of donor blood transfused, the number of units of donor blood products transfused, the thoracic drainage rate, and the total thoracic drainage volumes were also reduced in patients receiving Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> as compared to placebo.</p>

Two patients who experienced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity</span>/<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441202" conceptname="Anaphylaxis">anaphylactic reactions</span> subsequently died, 24 hours and 5 days after surgery, respectively. The relationship of these 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> to Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> is unclear. This retrospective review also showed that the incidence of a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441202" conceptname="Anaphylaxis">anaphylactic reaction</span> following re-exposure is increased when the re-exposure occurs within 6 months of the initial administration (5.0% for re-exposure within 6 months and 0.9% for re-exposure greater than 6 months). Other smaller studies have shown that in case of re-exposure, the incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity</span>/<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441202" conceptname="Anaphylaxis">anaphylactic reactions</span> may reach the five percent level.</p>
<p>An analysis of all spontaneous reports from the Bayer Global database covering a period from 1985 to March 2006 revealed that of 291 possibly associated spontaneous cases of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity</span> (fatal: n=52 and non-fatal: n=239), 47% (138/291) of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity</span> cases had documented previous exposure to Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span>.  Of the 138 cases with documented previous exposure, 110 had information on the time of the previous exposure.  Ninety-nine of the 110 cases had previous exposure within the prior 12 months.</p>

<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Renal Dysfunction:</span>  Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> administration increases the risk for renal dysfunction and may increase the need for dialysis in the perioperative period.  This risk may be especially increased for patients with pre-existing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> or those who receive aminoglycoside antibiotics or drugs that alter renal function.  Data from Bayer’s global pool of placebo-controlled studies in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery showed that the incidence of serum creatinine elevations &gt;0.5 mg/dL above pre-treatment levels was statistically higher at 9.0% (185/2047) in the high-dose aprotinin (Regimen A) group compared with 6.6% (129/1957) in the placebo group.  In the majority of instances, post-operative renal dysfunction was not severe and was reversible.  However, renal dysfunction may progress to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal failure</span> and the incidence of serum creatinine elevations &gt;2.0 mg/dL above baseline was slightly higher in the high-dose aprotinin group (1.1% vs. 0.8%).

<h2>General:</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Italics Underline">Initial (Test) Dose: </span> All patients treated with Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> should first receive an initial (test) dose to minimize the extent of Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> exposure and to help assess the potential for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">allergic reactions</span>.

<h2>Laboratory Monitoring of Anticoagulation during Cardiopulmonary Bypass: </h2>
<p class="First">Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> prolongs whole blood clotting times by a different mechanism than heparin. In the presence of aprotinin, prolongation is dependent on the type of whole blood clotting test employed. If an activated clotting time (ACT) is used to determine the effectiveness of heparin anticoagulation, the prolongation of the ACT by aprotinin may lead to an overestimation of the degree of anticoagulation, thereby leading to inadequate anticoagulation. During extended extracorporeal circulation, patients may require additional heparin, even in the presence of ACT levels that appear adequate.</p>
<p>In patients undergoing CPB with Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> therapy, one of the following methods may be employed to maintain adequate anticoagulation:</p>
<dl>
<dt>1)</dt>
<dd> ACT - An ACT is not a standardized coagulation test, and different formulations of the assay are affected differently by the presence of aprotinin. The test is further influenced by variable dilution effects and the temperature experienced during cardiopulmonary bypass. It has been observed that Kaolin-based ACTs are not increased to the same degree by aprotinin as are diatomaceous earth-based (celite) ACTs. While protocols vary, a minimal celite ACT of 750 seconds or kaolin-ACT of 480 seconds, independent of the effects of hemodilution and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435371" conceptname="Hypothermia">hypothermia</span>, is recommended in the presence of aprotinin. Consult the manufacturer of the ACT test regarding the interpretation of the assay in the presence of Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span>.</dd>
<dt>2)</dt>
<dd>Fixed Heparin Dosing - A standard loading dose of heparin, administered prior to cannulation of the heart, plus the quantity of heparin added to the prime volume of the CPB circuit, should total at least 350 IU/kg. Additional heparin should be administered in a fixed-dose regimen based on patient weight and duration of CPB.</dd>
<dt>3)</dt>
<dd> Heparin Titration - Protamine titration, a method that is not affected by aprotinin, can be used to measure heparin levels. A heparin dose response, assessed by protamine titration, should be performed prior to administration of aprotinin to determine the heparin loading dose. Additional heparin should be administered on the basis of heparin levels measured by protamine titration. Heparin levels during bypass should not be allowed to drop below 2.7 U/mL (2.0 mg/kg) or below the level indicated by heparin dose response testing performed prior to administration of aprotinin.</dd>
</dl>
<p><span class="Italics Underline">Protamine Administration</span> - In patients treated with Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span>, the amount of protamine administered to reverse heparin activity should be based on the actual amount of heparin administered, and not on the ACT values.</p>

<p>Although there was a statistically significantly increased risk of graft closure for Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> treated patients compared to patients who received placebo (p=0.035), further analysis showed a significant treatment by site interaction for one of the non-U.S. sites vs. the U.S. centers.

<p class="First">Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> given prophylactically in both Regimen A and Regimen B (half Regimen A) to patients undergoing CABG surgery significantly reduced the donor blood transfusion requirement relative to placebo treatment. In low risk patients there is no difference in efficacy between regimen A and B. Therefore, the dosage used (A vs. B) is at the discretion of the practitioner.</p>
<p>Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> is supplied as a solution containing 10,000 KIU/mL, which is equal to 1.4 mg/mL. All intravenous doses of Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> should be administered through a central line. <span class="Bold">DO NOT ADMINISTER ANY OTHER DRUG USING THE SAME LINE.</span> Both regimens include a 1 mL initial (test) dose, a loading dose, a dose to be added while <span class="Bold Underline">recirculating</span> the priming fluid of the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit (“pump prime? dose), and a constant infusion dose. To avoid physical incompatibility of Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> and heparin when adding to the pump prime solution, each agent must be added <span class="Bold Underline">during recirculation</span> of the pump prime to assure adequate dilution prior to admixture with the other component. Regimens A and B, both incorporating a 1 mL initial (test) dose, are described in the table below:</p>

<p>The 1 ml initial (test) dose should be administered intravenously at least 10 minutes before the loading dose. With the patient in a supine position, the loading dose is given slowly over 20-30 minutes, after induction of anesthesia but prior to sternotomy. In patients with known previous exposure to Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span>, the loading dose should be given just prior to cannulation. When the loading dose is complete, it is followed by the constant infusion dose, which is continued until surgery is complete and the patient leaves the operating room. The “pump prime? dose is added to the <span class="Bold Underline">recirculating</span> priming fluid of the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit, by replacement of an aliquot of the priming fluid, prior to the institution of cardiopulmonary bypass. Total doses of more than 7 million KIU have not been studied in controlled trials.</p>
<p>Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit. Discard any unused portion.</p>
