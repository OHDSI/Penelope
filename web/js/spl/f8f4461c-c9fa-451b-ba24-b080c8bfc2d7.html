<p><a name="ID281"></a>Maximum serum concentrations are attained 1 to 2 hours after oral dosing. Mean concentrations 12 hours after dosing with 250, 500, or 750 mg are 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 mcg/mL, respectively. The serum elimination half-life in subjects with normal renal function is approximately 4 hours. Serum concentrations increase proportionately with doses up to 1000 mg. </p>
<p>A 500 mg oral dose given every 12 hours has been shown to produce an area under the serum concentration time curve (AUC) equivalent to that produced by an intravenous infusion of 400 mg ciprofloxacin given over 60 minutes every 12 hours. A 750 mg oral dose given every 12 hours has been shown to produce an AUC at steady-state equivalent to that produced by an intravenous infusion of 400 mg given over 60 minutes every 8 hours. A 750 mg oral dose results in a C<span class="Sub">max</span> similar to that observed with a 400 mg IV dose. A 250 mg oral dose given every 12 hours produces an AUC equivalent to that produced by an infusion of 200 mg ciprofloxacin given every 12 hours.</p>

<h2>Distribution</h2>
<p class="First"><a name="ID284"></a>The binding of ciprofloxacin to serum proteins is 20 to 40% which is not likely to be high enough to cause significant protein binding interactions with other drugs. </p>
<p>After oral administration, ciprofloxacin is widely distributed throughout the body. Tissue concentrations often exceed serum concentrations in both men and women, particularly in genital tissue including the prostate. Ciprofloxacin is present in active form in the saliva, nasal and bronchial secretions, mucosa of the sinuses, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4102774" conceptname="Productive cough">sputum</span>, skin <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443720" conceptname="Blister">blister</span> fluid, lymph, peritoneal fluid, bile, and prostatic secretions. Ciprofloxacin has also been detected in lung, skin, fat, muscle, cartilage, and bone. The drug diffuses into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); however, CSF concentrations are generally less than 10% of peak serum concentrations. Low levels of the drug have been detected in the aqueous and vitreous humors of the eye. </p>
</div>
<div class="Section">
<a name="ID285"></a><a name="section-4.3"></a><p></p>
<h2>Metabolism</h2>
<p class="First"><a name="ID286"></a>Four metabolites have been identified in human urine which together account for approximately 15% of an oral dose. The metabolites have antimicrobial activity, but are less active than unchanged ciprofloxacin. Ciprofloxacin is an inhibitor of human cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) mediated metabolism. Coadministration of ciprofloxacin with other drugs primarily metabolized by CYP1A2 results in increased plasma concentrations of these drugs and could lead to clinically significant adverse events of the coadministered drug (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#ID320">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a>, <a href="#ID322">WARNINGS</a>, <a href="#ID349">PRECAUTIONS</a>, <a href="#ID361">Drug Interactions</a></span>). </p>
</div>
<div class="Section">
<a name="ID287"></a><a name="section-4.4"></a><p></p>
<h2>Excretion</h2>
<p class="First"><a name="ID288"></a>The serum elimination half-life in subjects with normal renal function is approximately 4 hours. Approximately 40 to 50% of an orally administered dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug. After a 250 mg oral dose, urine concentrations of ciprofloxacin usually exceed 200 mcg/mL during the first two hours and are approximately 30 mcg/mL at 8 to 12 hours after dosing. The urinary excretion of ciprofloxacin is virtually complete within 24 hours after dosing. The renal clearance of ciprofloxacin, which is approximately   300 mL/minute, exceeds the normal glomerular filtration rate of 120 mL/minute. Thus, active tubular secretion would seem to play a significant role in its elimination. Co-administration of probenecid with ciprofloxacin results in about a 50% reduction in the ciprofloxacin renal clearance and a 50% increase in its concentration in the systemic circulation. </p>
<p>Although bile concentrations of ciprofloxacin are several fold higher than serum concentrations after oral dosing, only a small amount of the dose administered is recovered from the bile as unchanged drug. An additional 1 to 2% of the dose is recovered from the bile in the form of metabolites. Approximately 20 to 35% of an oral dose is recovered from the feces within 5 days after dosing. This may arise from either biliary clearance or transintestinal elimination.</p>
<p>With oral administration, a 500 mg dose, given as 10 mL of the 5% ciprofloxacin for oral suspension (containing 250 mg ciprofloxacin/5mL) is bioequivalent to the 500 mg tablet. A 10 mL volume of the 5% ciprofloxacin for oral suspension (containing 250 mg ciprofloxacin/5mL) is bioequivalent to a 5 mL volume of the 10% ciprofloxacin for oral suspension (containing 500 mg ciprofloxacin/5mL). </p>

<div class="Section">

<h2>Drug-Drug Interactions</h2>
<p class="First"><a name="ID290"></a>When Ciprofloxacin Hydrochloride Tablet is given concomitantly with food, there is a delay in the absorption of the drug, resulting in peak concentrations that occur closer to 2 hours after dosing rather than 1 hour whereas there is no delay observed when ciprofloxacin for oral suspension is given with food. The overall absorption of ciprofloxacin hydrochloride tablet or ciprofloxacin for oral suspension, however, is not substantially affected. The pharmacokinetics of ciprofloxacin given as the suspension are also not affected by food. Concurrent administration of antacids containing magnesium hydroxide or aluminum hydroxide may reduce the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin by as much as 90% (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#ID349">PRECAUTIONS</a></span>). </p>
<p>The serum concentrations of ciprofloxacin and metronidazole were not altered when these two drugs were given concomitantly. </p>
<p>Concomitant administration with tizanidine is contraindicated (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#ID320">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a></span>). Concomitant administration of ciprofloxacin with theophylline decreases the clearance of theophylline resulting in elevated serum theophylline levels and increased risk of a patient developing CNS or other adverse reactions. Ciprofloxacin also decreases caffeine clearance and inhibits the formation of paraxanthine after caffeine administration (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#ID322">WARNINGS</a>: <a href="#ID349">PRECAUTIONS</a></span>). </p>
</div>
<div class="Section">
<a name="ID291"></a><a name="section-4.6"></a><p></p>
<h2>Special Populations</h2>
<p class="First"><a name="ID292"></a>Pharmacokinetic studies of the oral (single dose) and intravenous (single and multiple dose) forms of ciprofloxacin indicate that plasma concentrations of ciprofloxacin are higher in elderly subjects (&gt; 65 years) as compared to young adults. Although the C<span class="Sub">max</span> is increased 16-40%, the increase in mean AUC is approximately 30%, and can be at least partially attributed to decreased renal clearance in the elderly. Elimination half-life is only slightly (~20%) prolonged in the elderly. These differences are not considered clinically significant (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#ID373">PRECAUTIONS: Geriatric Use</a></span>). </p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">Renal Impairment</span> </span></span></p>
<p>In patients with reduced renal function, the half-life of ciprofloxacin is slightly prolonged. Dosage adjustments may be required (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#ID388">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span>). </p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4212540" conceptname="Chronic liver disease">Hepatic Impairment</span> </span></span></p>
<p>In preliminary studies in patients with stable chronic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4064161" conceptname="Cirrhosis of liver">liver cirrhosis</span>, no significant changes in ciprofloxacin pharmacokinetics have been observed. The kinetics of ciprofloxacin in patients with acute <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4245975" conceptname="Hepatic failure">hepatic insufficiency</span>, however, have not been fully elucidated. </p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Pediatrics </span></span></p>
<p>Following a single oral dose of 10 mg/kg ciprofloxacin suspension to 16 children ranging in age from 4 months to 7 years, the mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> was 2.4 mcg/mL (range: 1.5 to 3.4 mcg/mL) and the mean AUC was 9.2 mcg*h/mL (range: 5.8 to 14.9 mcg*h/mL). There was no apparent age-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span>, and no notable increase in C<span class="Sub">max</span> or AUC upon multiple dosing (10 mg/kg TID). In children with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="132797" conceptname="Sepsis">sepsis</span> who were given intravenous ciprofloxacin (10 mg/kg as a 1-hour infusion), the mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> was 6.1 mcg/mL (range: 4.6 to 8.3 mcg/mL) in 10 children less than 1 year of age; and 7.2 mcg/mL (range: 4.7 to 11.8 mcg/mL) in 10 children between 1 and 5 years of age. The AUC values were 17.4 mcg*h/mL (range: 11.8 to 32.0 mcg*h/mL) and 16.5 mcg*h/mL (range: 11.0 to 23.8 mcg*h/mL) in the respective age groups. These values are within the range reported for adults at therapeutic doses. Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis of pediatric patients with various <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span>, the predicted mean half-life in children is approximately 4 to 5 hours, and the bioavailability of the oral suspension is approximately 60%. </p>

<h2>Mechanism of Action</h2>
<p class="First"><a name="ID295"></a>The bactericidal action of ciprofloxacin results from inhibition of the enzymes topoisomerase II (DNA gyrase) and topoisomerase IV (both Type II topoisomerases), which are required for bacterial DNA replication, transcription, repair, and recombination. </p>

<h2>Mechanism of Resistance</h2>
<p class="First"><a name="ID297"></a>The mechanism of action of fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin, is different from that of penicillins, cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, macrolides, and tetracyclines; therefore, microorganisms resistant to these classes of drugs may be susceptible to ciprofloxacin. Resistance to fluoroquinolones occurs primarily by either mutations in the DNA gyrases, decreased outer membrane permeability, or drug efflux. <span class="Italics">In vitro </span>resistance to ciprofloxacin develops slowly by multiple step mutations. Resistance to ciprofloxacin due to spontaneous mutations occurs at a general frequency of between &lt; 10<span class="Sup">-9 </span>to 1x10<span class="Sup">-6</span>. </p>

<h2>Susceptibility Test Methods</h2>
<p class="First"><a name="ID308"></a>When available, the clinical microbiology laboratory should provide the results of <span class="Italics">in vitro </span>susceptibility test results for antimicrobial drug products used in resident hospitals to the physician as periodic reports that describe the susceptibility profile of nosocomial and community-acquired pathogens. These reports should aid the physician in selecting an antibacterial drug product for treatment.</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Dilution Techniques</span></span></p>
<p>Quantitative methods are used to determine antimicrobial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4190299" conceptname="Broth microdilution susceptibility test">minimum inhibitory concentrations</span> (MICs). These MICs provide estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds.

<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Diffusion Techniques</span></span></p>
<p>Quantitative methods that require measurement of zone diameters can also provide reproducible estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The zone size provides an estimate of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The zone size should be determined using a standardized test method.<span class="Sup">2,3,4 </span>This procedure uses paper disks impregnated with 5 mcg ciprofloxacin to test the susceptibility of bacteria to ciprofloxacin. The disc diffusion interpretive criteria are provided in Table 1.</p>

<p>NOTE: Although effective in clinical trials, ciprofloxacin is not a drug of first choice in the pediatric population due to an increased incidence of adverse events compared to controls, including events related to joints and/or surrounding tissues (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#ID322">WARNINGS</a>, <a href="#ID349">PRECAUTIONS</a></span>, <span class="Bold"><a href="#ID371">Pediatric Use</a></span>, <span class="Bold"><a href="#ID375">ADVERSE REACTIONS </a></span>and <span class="Bold"><a href="#ID405">CLINICAL STUDIES</a></span>).

<p>To reduce the incidence or progression of disease following exposure to aerosolized <span class="Italics">Bacillus anthracis. </span></p>
<p>Ciprofloxacin serum concentrations achieved in humans served as a surrogate endpoint reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit and provided the initial basis for approval of this indication.5 Supportive clinical information for ciprofloxacin for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438960" conceptname="Anthrax">anthrax</span> post-exposure prophylaxis was obtained during the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438960" conceptname="Anthrax">anthrax</span> bioterror attacks of October 2001 (see also, <span class="Bold"><a href="#ID409">INHALATIONAL <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438960" conceptname="Anthrax">ANTHRAX</span> â€“ ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</a></span>). </p>
<p>If anaerobic organisms are suspected of contributing to the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span>, appropriate therapy should be administered. Appropriate culture and susceptibility tests should be performed before treatment in order to isolate and identify organisms causing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span> and to determine their susceptibility to ciprofloxacin. Therapy with ciprofloxacin may be initiated before results of these tests are known; once results become available appropriate therapy should be continued. As with other drugs, some isolates of <span class="Italics">Pseudomonas aeruginosa </span>may develop resistance fairly rapidly during treatment with ciprofloxacin. Culture and susceptibility testing performed periodically during therapy will provide information not only on the therapeutic effect of the antimicrobial agent but also on the possible emergence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4207042" conceptname="Viral resistance">bacterial resistance</span>.</p>
<p>To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of ciprofloxacin for oral suspension and other antibacterial drugs, ciprofloxacin for oral suspension should be used only to treat or prevent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span> that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy. </p>

<h2>Drug Interactions</h2>
<p class="First"><a name="ID362"></a><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Tizanidine </span></span></p>
<p>In a pharmacokinetic study, systemic exposure of tizanidine (4 mg single dose) was significantly increased (C<span class="Sub">max</span> 7-fold, AUC 10-fold) when the drug was given concomitantly with ciprofloxacin (500 mg BID for 3 days). The hypotensive and sedative effects of tizanidine were also potentiated. Concomitant administration of tizanidine and ciprofloxacin is contraindicated (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#ID321">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a>)</span>. </p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Theophylline </span></span></p>
<p>As with some other quinolones, concurrent administration of ciprofloxacin with theophylline may lead to elevated serum concentrations of theophylline and prolongation of its elimination half-life. This may result in increased risk of theophylline-related adverse reactions (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#ID322">WARNINGS</a></span>). If concomitant use cannot be avoided, serum levels of theophylline should be monitored and dosage adjustments made as appropriate. </p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Other Xanthine Derivatives </span></span></p>
<p>Some quinolones, including ciprofloxacin, have also been shown to interfere with the metabolism of caffeine. This may lead to reduced clearance of caffeine and a prolongation of its serum half-life. On concurrent administration of ciprofloxacin and caffeine or pentoxifylline containing products, elevated serum concentrations of these xanthine derivatives were reported. </p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Chelation Complex Formation </span></span></p>
<p>Concurrent administration of a quinolone, including ciprofloxacin, with multivalent cation-containing products such as magnesium/aluminum antacids, polymeric phosphate binders (for example. sevelamer, lanthanum carbonate) sucralfate, Videx<span class="Sup">Â® </span>(didanosine) chewable/buffered tablets or pediatric powder, other highly buffered drugs, or products containing calcium, iron, or zinc may substantially decrease its absorption, resulting in serum and urine levels considerably lower than desired (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#ID388">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a>Â </span>for concurrent administration of these agents with ciprofloxacin). </p>
<p>Histamine H<span class="Sub">2</span>-receptor antagonists appear to have no significant effect on the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin. </p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Omeprazole </span></span></p>
<p>Concomitant administration of a single tablet dose of 500 mg ciprofloxacin and once-daily administration of 20 mg omeprazole pretreatment for 4 days resulted in a 16%reduction of mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> and mean AUC of ciprofloxacin </p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Phenytoin </span></span></p>
<p>Altered serum levels of phenytoin (increased and decreased) have been reported in patients receiving concomitant ciprofloxacin. To avoid the loss of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">seizure</span> control associated with decreased phenytoin levels, and to prevent phenytoin <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>-related undesirable effects when ciprofloxacin is discontinued in patients receiving both agents, monitoring of phenytoin therapy, including phenytoin serum concentration measurements, is recommended during and shortly after co-administration of ciprofloxacin with phenytoin. </p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Oral Antidiabetic Agents </span></span></p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">Hypoglycemia</span> has been reported when ciprofloxacin and oral antidiabetic agents, mainly sulfonylureas (for example, glyburide, glimepiride), were co-administered, presumably by intensifying the action of the oral antidiabetic agent (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#ID375">ADVERSE REACTIONS</a></span>). The concomitant administration of ciprofloxacin with glyburide has, on rare occasions, resulted in severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="24609" conceptname="Hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</span>. Fatalities have been reported. </p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Metronidazole </span></span></p>
<p>The serum concentrations of ciprofloxacin and metronidazole were not altered when these two drugs were given concomitantly. </p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Cyclosporine </span></span></p>
<p>Some quinolones, including ciprofloxacin, have been associated with transient elevations in serum creatinine in patients receiving cyclosporine concomitantly. </p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Oral Anti-coagulants </span></span></p>
<p>Simultaneous administration of ciprofloxacin with an oral anticoagulant may augment the effect of the anticoagulant. The risk may vary with the underlying <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span>, age and general status of the patient so that the contribution of ciprofloxacin to the increase in INR (international normalized ratio) is difficult to assess. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4173906" conceptname="Clotting factor II assay">Prothrombin</span> time and INR should be monitored frequently during and shortly after co-administration of ciprofloxacin with an oral anticoagulant (for example, warfarin).</p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Probenecid </span></span></p>
<p>Probenecid interferes with renal tubular secretion of ciprofloxacin and produces an increase in the level of ciprofloxacin in the serum. This should be considered if patients are receiving both drugs concomitantly. </p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Methotrexate </span></span></p>
<p>Renal tubular transport of methotrexate may be inhibited by concomitant administration of ciprofloxacin potentially leading to increased plasma levels of methotrexate. This might increase the risk of methotrexate associated toxic reactions. Therefore, patients under methotrexate therapy should be carefully monitored when concomitant ciprofloxacin therapy is indicated. </p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Metoclopramide </span></span></p>
<p>Metoclopramide significantly accelerates the absorption of oral ciprofloxacin resulting in shorter time to reach maximum plasma concentrations. No significant effect was observed on the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin. </p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Duloxetine </span></span></p>
<p>In clinical studies it was demonstrated that concomitant use of duloxetine with strong inhibitors of the CYP450 1A2 isozyme such as fluvoxamine, may result in a 5-fold increase in mean AUC and a 2.5-fold increase in mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> of duloxetine. Although no clinical data are available on a possible interaction with ciprofloxacin, similar effects can be expected upon concomitant administration. </p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">NSAIDs </span></span></p>
<p>Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (but not acetyl salicylic acid) in combination of very high doses of quinolones have been shown to provoke <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span> in pre-clinical studies. </p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Ropinirole </span></span></p>
<p>In a study conducted in 12 patients with Parkinson's disease who were administered 6 mg ropinirole once daily with 500 mg ciprofloxacin twice-daily, the mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> and mean AUC of ropinirole were increased by 60% and 84%, respectively. Monitoring for ropinirole-related side effects and appropriate dose adjustment of ropinirole is recommended during and shortly after co-administration with ciprofloxacin (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#ID345">WARNINGS, Cytochrome P450</a></span>). </p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Lidocaine </span></span></p>
<p>In a study conducted in 9 healthy volunteers, concomitant use of 1.5 mg/kg IV lidocaine with 500 mg ciprofloxacin twice daily, resulted in an increase of lidocaine C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC by 12% and 26%, respectively. Although lidocaine treatment was well tolerated at this elevated exposure, a possible interaction with ciprofloxacin and an increase in side effects related to lidocaine may occur upon concomitant administration. </p>

<p class="First"><a name="ID364"></a><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Clozapine </span></span></p>
<p>Following concomitant administration of 250 mg ciprofloxacin with 304 mg clozapine for 7 days, serum concentrations of clozapine and N-desmethylclozapine were increased by 29% and 31%, respectively. Careful monitoring of clozapine associated adverse effects and appropriate adjustment of clozapine dosage during and shortly after co-administration with ciprofloxacin are advised. (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#ID322">WARNINGS</a></span>). </p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Sildenafil </span></span></p>
<p>Following concomitant administration of a single oral dose of 50 mg sildenafil with 500 mg ciprofloxacin to healthy subjects, the mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> and mean AUC of sildenafil were both increased approximately two-fold. Therefore, sildenafil should be used with caution when co-administered with ciprofloxacin. </p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Drugs Known To Prolong QT Interval </span></span></p>
<p>Precaution should be taken when using ciprofloxacin concomitantly with drugs known to prolong the QT interval (for example, class IA or III antiarrhythmics, tricyclic antidepressants, macrolides, antipsychotics) as ciprofloxacin may have an additive effect on the QT interval (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#ID343">WARNINGS, Prolongation of the QT Interval </a></span>and <span class="Bold"><a href="#ID373">PRECAUTIONS, Geriatric Use</a></span>). </p>

<p><span class="Italics">Saccharomyces cerevisiae </span>Mitotic Crossover and Gene Conversion Assay (Negative) </p>
<p>Rat Hepatocyte DNA Repair Assay (Positive) </p>
<p>Thus, 2 of the 8 tests were positive, but results of the following 3 <span class="Italics">in vivo </span>test systems gave negative results: </p>
<p>Rat Hepatocyte DNA Repair Assay </p>
<p>Micronucleus Test (Mice) </p>
<p>Dominant Lethal Test (Mice) </p>
<p>Long-term carcinogenicity studies in rats and mice resulted in no carcinogenic or tumorigenic effects due to ciprofloxacin at daily oral dose levels up to 250 and 750 mg/kg to rats and mice, respectively (approximately 1.7- and 2.5- times the highest recommended therapeutic dose based upon mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>). </p>
<p>Results from photo co-carcinogenicity testing indicate that ciprofloxacin does not reduce the time to appearance of UV-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135777" conceptname="Neoplasm of uncertain behavior of skin">skin tumors</span> as compared to vehicle control. Hairless   (Skh-1) mice were exposed to UVA light for 3.5 hours five times every two weeks for up to 78 weeks while concurrently being administered ciprofloxacin. The time to development of the first <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135777" conceptname="Neoplasm of uncertain behavior of skin">skin tumors</span> was 50 weeks in mice treated concomitantly with UVA and ciprofloxacin (mouse dose approximately equal to maximum recommended human dose based upon mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>), as opposed to 34 weeks when animals were treated with both UVA and vehicle.

<h2>Pregnancy</h2>
<p class="First"><a name="ID368"></a><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Teratogenic Effects. Pregnancy Category C </span></span></p>
<p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Ciprofloxacin should not be used during pregnancy unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to both fetus and mother (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#ID322">WARNINGS</a></span>). An expert review of published data on experiences with ciprofloxacin use during pregnancy by TERIS â€“ the Teratogen Information System â€“ concluded that therapeutic doses during pregnancy are unlikely to pose a substantial teratogenic risk (quantity and quality of data=fair), but the data are insufficient to state that there is no risk.<span class="Sup">9 </span></p>
<p>A controlled prospective observational study followed 200 women exposed to fluoroquinolones (52.5% exposed to ciprofloxacin and 68% first trimester exposures) during gestation.<span class="Sup">10 </span>In utero exposure to fluoroquinolones during embryogenesis was not associated with increased risk of major malformations. The reported rates of major congenital malformations were 2.2% for the fluoroquinolone group and 2.6% for the control group (background incidence of major malformations is 1 to 5%). Rates of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4067106" conceptname="Miscarriage">spontaneous abortions</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439128" conceptname="Extreme immaturity">prematurity</span> and low birth weight did not differ between the groups and there were no clinically significant musculoskeletal dysfunctions up to one year of age in the ciprofloxacin exposed children. </p>
<p>Another prospective follow-up study reported on 549 pregnancies with fluoroquinolone exposure (93% first trimester exposures).<span class="Sup">11 </span>There were 70 ciprofloxacin exposures, all within the first trimester. The malformation rates among live-born babies exposed to ciprofloxacin and to fluoroquinolones overall were both within background incidence ranges. No specific patterns of congenital abnormalities were found. The study did not reveal any clear adverse reactions due to in utero exposure to ciprofloxacin. </p>
<p>No differences in the rates of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439128" conceptname="Extreme immaturity">prematurity</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4067106" conceptname="Miscarriage">spontaneous abortions</span>, or birth weight were seen in women exposed to ciprofloxacin during pregnancy.<span class="Sup">9,10 </span>However, these small postmarketing epidemiology studies, of which most experience is from short term, first trimester exposure, are insufficient to evaluate the risk for less common defects or to permit reliable and definitive conclusions regarding the safety of ciprofloxacin in pregnant women and their developing fetuses. Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and mice using oral doses up to 100 mg/kg (0.6 and 0.3 times the maximum daily human dose based upon body surface area, respectively) and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to ciprofloxacin. In rabbits, oral ciprofloxacin dose levels of 30 and 100 mg/kg (approximately 0.4- and 1.3-times the highest recommended therapeutic dose based upon mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>) produced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="197596" conceptname="Toxic gastroenteritis">gastrointestinal toxicity</span> resulting in maternal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134010" conceptname="Weight decreased">weight loss</span> and an increased incidence of abortion, but no <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4240324" conceptname="Teratogenesis">teratogenicity</span> was observed at either dose level.

No alteration of dosage is necessary for patients greater than 65 years of age with normal renal function. However, since some older individuals experience reduced renal function by virtue of their advanced age, care should be taken in dose selection for elderly patients, and renal function monitoring may be useful in these patients (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#ID277">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY </a></span>and <span class="Bold"><a href="#ID388">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span>). </p>
<p>In general, elderly patients may be more susceptible to drug-associated effects on the QT interval. Therefore, precaution should be taken when using ciprofloxacin with concomitant drugs that can result in prolongation of the QT interval (for example, class IA or class III antiarrhythmics) or in patients with risk factors for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4135823" conceptname="Torsades de pointes">torsade de pointes</span> (for example, known QT prolongation, uncorrected <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437833" conceptname="Hypokalemia">hypokalemia</span>).

<h2>Adverse Reactions in Adult Patients</h2>
<p class="First"><a name="ID377"></a>During clinical investigations with oral and parenteral ciprofloxacin, 49,038 patients received courses of the drug. Most of the adverse events reported were described as only mild or moderate in severity, abated soon after the drug was discontinued, and required no treatment. Ciprofloxacin was discontinued because of an adverse event in 1% of orally treated patients. </p>
<p>The most frequently reported drug related events, from clinical trials of all formulations, all dosages, all drug-therapy durations, and for all indications of ciprofloxacin therapy were <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span> (2.5%), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span> (1.6%), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438878" conceptname="Liver function tests abnormal">liver function tests abnormal</span> (1.3%), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span> (1%), and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span> (1%). </p>

<h2>Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients</h2>
<p class="First"><a name="ID379"></a>Ciprofloxacin, administered IV and /or orally, was compared to a cephalosporin for treatment of complicated <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="81902" conceptname="Urinary tract infectious disease">urinary tract infections</span> (cUTI) or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198199" conceptname="Pyelonephritis">pyelonephritis</span> in pediatric patients   1 to 17 years of age (mean age of 6 Â± 4 years). The trial was conducted in the US, Canada, Argentina, Peru, Costa Rica, Mexico, South Africa, and Germany. The duration of therapy was 10 to 21 days (mean duration of treatment was 11 days with a range of 1 to 88 days). The primary objective of the study was to assess musculoskeletal and neurological safety within 6 weeks of therapy and through one year of follow-up in the 335 ciprofloxacin- and 349 comparator-treated patients enrolled. </p>
<p>An Independent Pediatric Safety Committee (IPSC) reviewed all cases of musculoskeletal adverse events as well as all patients with an <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437643" conceptname="Abnormal gait">abnormal gait</span> or abnormal joint exam (baseline or treatment-emergent). These events were evaluated in a comprehensive fashion and included such conditions as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="77074" conceptname="Joint pain">arthralgia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437643" conceptname="Abnormal gait">abnormal gait</span>, abnormal joint exam, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="30234" conceptname="Neck sprain">joint sprains</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138525" conceptname="Pain in limb">leg pain</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="134736" conceptname="Backache">back pain</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="73553" conceptname="Arthropathy">arthrosis</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4129418" conceptname="Bone pain">bone pain</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442752" conceptname="Muscle pain">myalgia</span>, arm <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>, and decreased range of motion in a joint. The affected joints included: knee, elbow, ankle, hip, wrist, and shoulder. Within 6 weeks of treatment initiation, the rates of these events were 9.3% (31/335) in the ciprofloxacin-treated group versus 6 % (21/349) in comparator-treated patients. The majority of these events were mild or moderate in intensity. All musculoskeletal events occurring by 6 weeks resolved (clinical resolution of signs and symptoms), usually within 30 days of end of treatment. Radiological evaluations were not routinely used to confirm resolution of the events. The events occurred more frequently in ciprofloxacin-treated patients than control patients, regardless of whether they received IV or oral therapy. Ciprofloxacin-treated patients were more likely to report more than one event and on more than one occasion compared to control patients. These events occurred in all age groups and the rates were consistently higher in the ciprofloxacin group compared to the control group. At the end of </p>
<p>1 year, the rate of these events reported at any time during that period was 13.7% (46/335) in the ciprofloxacin-treated group versus 9.5% (33/349) comparator-treated patients.</p>

Serious adverse events were seen in 7.5% (25/335) of ciprofloxacin-treated patients compared to 5.7% (20/349) of control patients. Discontinuation of drug due to an adverse event was observed in 3% (10/335) of ciprofloxacin-treated patients versus 1.4% (5/349) of comparator patients. Other adverse events that occurred in at least 1% of ciprofloxacin patients were <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="80141" conceptname="Functional diarrhea">diarrhea</span> 4.8%, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span> 4.8%, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="200219" conceptname="Abdominal pain">abdominal pain</span> 3.3%, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433633" conceptname="Late effect of superficial injury">accidental injury</span> 3%, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4320791" conceptname="Rhinitis">rhinitis</span> 3%, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="23325" conceptname="Heartburn">dyspepsia</span> 2.7%, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span> 2.7%, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span> 2.1%, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span> 1.8% and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span> 1.8%. </p>

<h2>Postmarketing Adverse Event Reports</h2>
<p class="First"><a name="ID383"></a>The following adverse events have been reported from worldwide marketing experience with fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these events in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the event, (2) frequency of the reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to the drug. </p>

<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<p class="First"><a name="ID387"></a>In the event of acute overdosage, reversible renal toxicity has been reported in some cases. The stomach should be emptied by inducing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span> or by gastric lavage. The patient should be carefully observed and given supportive treatment, including monitoring of renal function, urinary pH and acidify, if required, to prevent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4188213" conceptname="Crystalluria">crystalluria</span> and administration of magnesium, aluminum, or calcium containing antacids, which can reduce the absorption of ciprofloxacin. Adequate hydration must be maintained. Only a small amount of ciprofloxacin (&lt; 10%) is removed from the body after hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. </p>
<p>Single doses of ciprofloxacin were relatively non-toxic via the oral route of administration in mice, rats, and dogs. No <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> occurred within a 14-day post treatment observation period at the highest oral doses tested; up to 5000 mg/kg in either rodent species, or up to 2500 mg/kg in the dog.

<div class="Section">
<a name="ID389"></a><a name="section-12.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>Adults</h2>
<p class="First"><a name="ID390"></a>Ciprofloxacin for oral suspension should be administered orally to adults as described in the Dosage Guidelines table. </p>
<p>The determination of dosage for any particular patient must take into consideration the severity and nature of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span>, the susceptibility of the causative organism, the integrity of the patient's host-defense mechanisms, and the status of renal function and hepatic function. </p>
<p>The duration of treatment depends upon the severity of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span>. The usual duration is 7 to 14 days; however, for severe and complicated <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span> more prolonged therapy may be required. Ciprofloxacin should be administered at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after magnesium/aluminum antacids, polymeric phosphate binders (for example, sevelamer, lanthanum carbonate) or sucralfate, Videx<span class="Sup">Â® </span>(didanosine) chewable/buffered tablets or pediatric powder for oral solution, other highly buffered drugs, or other products containing calcium, iron or zinc.</p>

<p>Ciprofloxacin and other quinolones have been shown to cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="73553" conceptname="Arthropathy">arthropathy</span> in immature animals of most species tested (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#ID322">WARNINGS</a></span>). Damage of weight bearing joints was observed in juvenile dogs and rats. In young beagles, 100 mg/kg ciprofloxacin, given daily for 4 weeks, caused degenerative articular changes of the knee joint. At 30 mg/kg, the effect on the joint was minimal. In a subsequent study in young beagle dogs, oral ciprofloxacin doses of 30 mg/kg and 90 mg/kg ciprofloxacin (approximately 1.3-and 3.5-times the pediatric dose based upon comparative plasma AUCs) given daily for 2 weeks caused articular changes which were still observed by histopathology after a treatment-free period of 5 months. At 10 mg/kg (approximately 0.6-times the pediatric dose based upon comparative plasma AUCs), no effects on joints were observed. This dose was also not associated with arthrotoxicity after an additional treatment-free period of 5 months. In another study, removal of weight bearing from the joint reduced the lesions but did not totally prevent them. </p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4188213" conceptname="Crystalluria">Crystalluria</span>, sometimes associated with secondary <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198124" conceptname="Kidney disease">nephropathy</span>, occurs in laboratory animals dosed with ciprofloxacin. This is primarily related to the reduced solubility of ciprofloxacin under alkaline conditions, which predominate in the urine of test animals; in man, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4188213" conceptname="Crystalluria">crystalluria</span> is rare since human urine is typically acidic. In rhesus monkeys, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4188213" conceptname="Crystalluria">crystalluria</span> without <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198124" conceptname="Kidney disease">nephropathy</span> was noted after single oral doses as low as 5 mg/kg. (approximately 0.07-times the highest recommended therapeutic dose based upon mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>). After 6 months of intravenous dosing at 10 mg/kg/day, no nephropathological changes were noted; however, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198124" conceptname="Kidney disease">nephropathy</span> was observed after dosing at 20 mg/kg/day for the same duration (approximately 0.2-times the highest recommended therapeutic dose based upon mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>). </p>
<p>In dogs, ciprofloxacin at 3 and 10 mg/kg by rapid IV injection (15 sec.) produces pronounced hypotensive effects. These effects are considered to be related to histamine release, since they are partially antagonized by pyrilamine, an antihistamine. In rhesus monkeys, rapid IV injection also produces <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> but the effect in this species is inconsistent and less pronounced. </p>
<p>In mice, concomitant administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as phenylbutazone and indomethacin with quinolones has been reported to enhance the CNS stimulatory effect of quinolones. </p>
<p>Ocular toxicity seen with some related drugs has not been observed in ciprofloxacin-treated animals.</p>

The trial was conducted in the US, Canada, Argentina, Peru, Costa Rica, Mexico, South Africa, and Germany. The duration of therapy was 10 to 21 days (mean duration of treatment was 11 days with a range of 1 to 88 days). The primary objective of the study was to assess musculoskeletal and neurological safety. </p>
<p>Patients were evaluated for clinical success and bacteriological eradication of the baseline organism(s) with no new <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4105019" conceptname="Superimposed infection">superinfection</span> at 5 to 9 days post-therapy (Test of Cure or TOC).

<h2>Inhalational <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438960" conceptname="Anthrax">Anthrax</span> In Adults and Pediatrics</h2>
<p class="First"><a name="ID410"></a><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Additional Information </span></span></p>
<p>The mean serum concentrations of ciprofloxacin associated with a statistically significant improvement in survival in the rhesus monkey model of inhalational <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438960" conceptname="Anthrax">anthrax</span> are reached or exceeded in adult and pediatric patients receiving oral and intravenous regimens (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#ID388">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a></span>). Ciprofloxacin pharmacokinetics have been evaluated in various human populations. The mean peak serum concentration achieved at steady-state in human adults receiving 500 mg orally every 12 hours is 2.97 mcg/mL, and 4.56 mcg/mL following 400 mg intravenously every 12 hours. The mean trough serum concentration at steady-state for both of these regimens is 0.2 mcg/mL. In a study of 10 pediatric patients between 6 and 16 years of age, the mean peak plasma concentration achieved is 8.3 mcg/mL and trough concentrations range from 0.09 to 0.26 mcg/mL, following two 30-minute intravenous infusions of 10 mg/kg administered 12 hours apart. After the second intravenous infusion patients switched to 15 mg/kg orally every 12 hours achieve a mean peak concentration of 3.6 mcg/mL after the initial oral dose. Long-term safety data, including effects on cartilage, following the administration of ciprofloxacin to pediatric patients are limited. (For additional information, see <span class="Bold"><a href="#ID371">PRECAUTIONS, Pediatric Use</a></span>). Ciprofloxacin serum concentrations achieved in humans serve as a surrogate endpoint reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit and provide the basis for this indication.<span class="Sup">6 </span>A placebo-controlled animal study in rhesus monkeys exposed to an inhaled mean dose of 11 LD<span class="Sub">50</span> (~5.5 x 10<span class="Sup">5 </span>spores (range 5-30 LD50) of <span class="Italics">B. anthracis </span>was conducted. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ciprofloxacin for the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438960" conceptname="Anthrax">anthrax</span> <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strain</span> used in this study was 0.08 mcg/mL. In the animals studied, mean serum concentrations of ciprofloxacin achieved at expected T<span class="Sub">max</span> (1 hour post-dose) following oral dosing to steady-state ranged from 0.98 to 1.69 mcg/mL. Mean steady-state trough concentrations at 12 hours post-dose ranged from 0.12 to 0.19 mcg/mL.<span class="Sup">7 </span>Mortality due to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438960" conceptname="Anthrax">anthrax</span> for animals that received a 30-day regimen of oral ciprofloxacin beginning 24 hours post-exposure was significantly lower (1/9), compared to the placebo group (9/10) [p= 0.001]. The one ciprofloxacin-treated animal that died of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438960" conceptname="Anthrax">anthrax</span> did so following the 30-day drug administration period.<span class="Sup">8 </span></p>
<p>More than 9300 persons were recommended to complete a minimum of 60 days of antibiotic prophylaxis against possible inhalational exposure to <span class="Italics">B. anthracis </span>during 2001. Ciprofloxacin was recommended to most of those individuals for all or part of the prophylaxis regimen. Some persons were also given <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438960" conceptname="Anthrax">anthrax</span> vaccine or were switched to alternative antibiotics. No one who received ciprofloxacin or other therapies as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4118659" conceptname="Prophylactic">prophylactic</span> treatment subsequently developed inhalational <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438960" conceptname="Anthrax">anthrax</span>. The number of persons who received ciprofloxacin as all or part of their post-exposure prophylaxis regimen is unknown. </p>
<p>Among the persons surveyed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, over 1000 reported receiving ciprofloxacin as sole post-exposure prophylaxis for inhalational <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438960" conceptname="Anthrax">anthrax</span>.

This higher incidence, in the absence of a control group, could be explained by a reporting bias, concurrent medical conditions, other concomitant medications, emotional stress or other confounding factors, and/or a longer treatment period with ciprofloxacin. Because of these factors and limitations in the data collection, it is difficult to evaluate whether the reported symptoms were drug-related. </p>

<p><span class="Bold">Rx only</span></p>
<p>Read the Medication Guide that comes with ciprofloxacin for oral suspension<span class="Sup">Â </span>before you start taking it and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This Medication Guide does not take the place of talking to your healthcare provider about your medical condition or your treatment. </p>
<p><span class="Bold">What is the most important information I should know about Ciprofloxacin? </span></p>
<p>Ciprofloxacin belongs to a class of antibiotics called fluoroquinolones. Ciprofloxacin can cause side effects that may be serious or even cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>. If you get any of the following serious side effects, get medical help right away. Talk with your healthcare provider about whether you should continue to take ciprofloxacin. </p>

<p><span class="Bold">What is Ciprofloxacin? </span></p>
<p>Ciprofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic medicine used to treat certain <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span> caused by certain germs called bacteria. </p>
<p>Children less than 18 years of age have a higher chance of getting bone, joint, or tendon (musculoskeletal) problems such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4275722" conceptname="Swelling">swelling</span> while taking ciprofloxacin. Ciprofloxacin should not be used as the first choice of antibiotic medicine in children under 18 years of age. </p>
<p>Ciprofloxacin for oral suspension should not be used in children under 18 years old, except to treat specific serious <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span>, such as complicated <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="81902" conceptname="Urinary tract infectious disease">urinary tract infections</span> and to prevent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438960" conceptname="Anthrax">anthrax</span> disease after breathing the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438960" conceptname="Anthrax">anthrax</span> bacteria germ (inhalational exposure). </p>
<p>Sometimes <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infections</span> are caused by viruses rather than by bacteria. Examples include <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440029" conceptname="Viral disease">viral infections</span> in the sinuses and lungs, such as the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="260427" conceptname="Common cold">common cold</span> or flu. Antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin, do not kill viruses. </p>
<p>Call your healthcare provider if you think your condition is not getting better while you are taking ciprofloxacin. </p>
<p><span class="Bold">Who should not take Ciprofloxacin for Oral Suspension? </span></p>
<p>Do not take ciprofloxacin for oral suspension if you: </p>
<ul class="Disc">
<li>Have ever had a severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">allergic reaction</span> to an antibiotic known      as a fluoroquinolone, or are allergic to any of the ingredients in      ciprofloxacin for oral suspension.
