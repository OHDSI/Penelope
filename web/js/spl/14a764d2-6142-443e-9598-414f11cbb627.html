<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>Prazosin hydrochloride, a quinazoline derivative, is the first of a new chemical class of antihypertensives. It is the hydrochloride salt of 1-(4-amino-6,7-dimethoxy-2-quinazolinyl)-4-(2-furoyl) piperazine and its structural formula is:<br><div class="Figure"><img alt="MM1" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=14a764d2-6142-443e-9598-414f11cbb627&amp;name=MM1.jpg"></div>
<br><br>Prazosin hydrochloride, USP is a white to tan powder, slightly soluble in water and methanol, very slightly soluble in alcohol, practically insoluble in chloroform and acetone and has a molecular weight of 419.87.

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>The exact mechanism of the hypotensive action of prazosin is unknown. Prazosin causes a decrease in total peripheral resistance and was originally thought to have a direct relaxant action on vascular smooth muscle. Recent animal studies, however, have suggested that the vasodilator effect of prazosin is also related to blockade of postsynaptic alpha-adrenoceptors. The results of dog forelimb experiments demonstrate that the peripheral vasodilator effect of prazosin is confined mainly to the level of the resistance vessels (arterioles). Unlike conventional alpha-blockers, the antihypertensive action of prazosin is usually not accompanied by a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="444070" conceptname="Tachycardia">reflex tachycardia</span>. Tolerance has not been observed to develop in long-term therapy.<br>Hemodynamic studies have been carried out in man following acute single dose administration and during the course of long-term maintenance therapy. The results confirm that the therapeutic effect is a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="314171" conceptname="Low blood pressure reading">fall in blood pressure</span> unaccompanied by a clinically significant change in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4221102" conceptname="Cardiac output">cardiac output</span>, heart rate, renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate. There is no measurable negative chronotropic effect.<br>In clinical studies to date, prazosin has not increased plasma renin activity.<br>In man, blood pressure is lowered in both the supine and standing positions. This effect is most pronounced on the diastolic blood pressure.<br>Following oral administration, human plasma concentrations reach a peak at about 3 hours with a plasma half-life of 2 to 3 hours. The drug is highly bound to plasma protein. Bioavailability studies have demonstrated that the total absorption relative to the drug in a 20% alcoholic solution is 90%, resulting in peak levels approximately 65% of that of the drug in solution. Animal studies indicate that prazosin is extensively metabolized, primarily by demethylation and conjugation, and excreted mainly via bile and feces. Less extensive human studies suggest similar metabolism and excretion in man.<br>In clinical studies in which lipid profiles were followed, there were generally no adverse changes noted between pre- and post-treatment lipid levels.<br><br>

<h1>WARNINGS</h1>
<span class="Bold">As with all alpha-blockers, prazosin hydrochloride may cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135360" conceptname="Syncope">syncope</span> with suddent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="372448" conceptname="Loss of consciousness">loss of consciousness</span>. In most cases this is believed to be due to an excessive postural hypotensive effect, altough occasionally the syncopal episode has been preceded by a bout of severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">tachycardia</span> with heart rates of 120 to 160 beats per minute. Syncopal episodes have usually occurred within 30 to 90 minutes of the initial dose of the drug; occasionally they have been reported in association wiht rapid dosage increases or the introduction of another antihypertensive drug into the regimen of a patient taking high doses of prazosin. The incidence of syncopal episodes is approximately 1% in patients given an initial dose of 2 mg or greater. Clinical trials conducted during the investigational phase of this drug suggest that syncopal episodes can be minimized by limiting the initial dose of the drug to 1 mg, by subsequently increasing the dosage slowly, and by indroducing any additional antihypertensive durgs into the patient's regimen with caution (seeDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">Hypotension</span> may develop in patients given prazosin who are also receiving a beta-blocker such as propranolol.</span><br>If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135360" conceptname="Syncope">syncope</span> occurs, the patient should be placed in the recumbent position and treated supportively as necessary.
