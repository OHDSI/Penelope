<a name="Section_2.1"></a><a name="section-3.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>Central Nervous System</h2>
<p class="First">Oxycodone is a semisynthetic pure opioid agonist whose principal therapeutic action  is <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>. Other pharmacological effects of oxycodone include anxiolysis, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4142453" conceptname="Feeling high">euphoria</span> and feelings of relaxation. These effects are mediated by receptors (notably μ and к) in the central nervous system for endogenous opioid-like compounds such as endorphins and enkephalins. Oxycodone produces <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> through direct activity at respiratory centers in the brain stem and depresses the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="254761" conceptname="Cough">cough</span> reflex by direct effect on the center of the medulla.</p>
<p>Acetaminophen is a non-opiate, non-salicylate analgesic and antipyretic. The site and mechanism for the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesic effect</span> of acetaminophen has not been determined. The antipyretic effect of acetaminophen is accomplished through the inhibition of endogenous pyrogen action on the hypothalamic heat-regulating centers.</p>

<a name="Section_2.2"></a><a name="section-3.2"></a><p></p>
<h2>Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle</h2>
<p class="First">Oxycodone reduces motility by increasing smooth muscle tone in the stomach and duodenum. In the small intestine, digestion of food is delayed by decreases in propulsive contractions. Other opioid effects include contraction of biliary tract smooth muscle, spasm of the Sphincter of Oddi, increased ureteral and bladder sphincter tone, and a reduction in uterine tone. </p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics">Absorption and Distribution</span></p>
<p>The mean absolute oral bioavailability of oxycodone in cancer patients was reported to be about 87%. Oxycodone has been shown to be 45% bound to human plasma proteins <span class="Italics">in vitro</span>. The volume of distribution after intravenous administration is 211.9 ±186.6 L.</p>
<p>Absorption of acetaminophen is rapid and almost complete from the GI tract after oral administration. With overdosage, absorption is complete in 4 hours. Acetaminophen is relatively uniformly distributed throughout most body fluids. Binding of the drug to plasma proteins is variable; only 20% to 50% may be bound at the concentrations encountered during acute <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">intoxication</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Bold Italics">Metabolism and Elimination</span></p>
<p>A high portion of oxycodone is N-dealkylated to noroxycodone during first-pass metabolism. Oxymorphone, is formed by the O-demethylation of oxycodone. The metabolism of oxycodone to oxymorphone is catalyzed by CYP2D6. Free and conjugated noroxycodone, free and conjugated oxycodone, and oxymorphone are excreted in human urine following a single oral dose of oxycodone. Approximately 8% to 14% of the dose is excreted as free oxydocone over 24 hours after administration. Following a single, oral dose of oxycodone, the mean ± SD elimination half-life is 3.51 ± 1.43 hours.</p>
<p>Acetaminophen is metabolized in the liver via cytochrome P450 microsomal enzyme.  About 80 to 85% of the acetaminophen in the body is conjugated principally with glucuronic acid and to a lesser extent with sulfuric acid and cysteine.  After hepatic conjugation, 90 to 100% of the drug is recovered in the urine with in the first day.</p>
<p>About 4% of acetaminophen is metabolized via cytochrome P450 oxidase to a toxic metabolite which is further detoxified by conjugation with glutathione, present in a fixed amount.  It is believed that the toxic metabolite NAPQI (N acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine, N-acetylimidoquinone) is responsible for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4337543" conceptname="Hepatic necrosis">liver necrosis</span>.  High doses of acetaminophen may deplete the glutathione stores so that inactivation of the toxic metabolite is decreased.  At high doses, the capacity of metabolic pathways for conjugation with glucuronic acid and sulfuric acid may be exceeded, resulting in increased metabolism of acetaminophen by alternate pathways.</p>

<h2>Misuse, Abuse and Diversion of Opioids</h2>
<p class="First">Oxycodone is an opioid agonist of the morphine-type. Such drugs are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion.</p>
<p>Oxycodone can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit. This should be considered when prescribing or dispensing oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets in situations where the physician or pharmacist is concerned about an increased risk of misuse, abuse or diversion. Concerns about misuse, addiction and diversion should not prevent the proper management of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span>.</p>
<p>Healthcare professionals should contact their State Professional Licensing Board or State Controlled Substances Authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product.</p>

<h2><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">Respiratory Depression</span></h2>
<p class="First"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">Respiratory depression</span> is a hazard with the use of oxycodone, one of the active ingredients in oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets, as with all opioid agonists. Elderly and debilitated patients are at particular risk for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span> as are non-tolerant patients given large initial doses of oxycodone or when oxycodone is given in conjunction with other agents that depress respiration. Oxycodone should be used with extreme caution in patients with acute <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span>, chronic obstructive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="257907" conceptname="Disorder of lung">pulmonary disorder</span> (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="255573" conceptname="Chronic obstructive lung disease">COPD</span>), <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4307356" conceptname="Cor pulmonale">cor pulmonale</span>, or preexisting respiratory impairment. In such patients, even usual therapeutic doses of oxycodone may decrease respiratory drive to the point of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="321689" conceptname="Apnea">apnea</span>. In these patients alternative non-opioid analgesics should be considered, and opioids should be employed only under careful medical supervision at the lowest effective dose.</p>
<p>In case of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>, a reversal agent such as naloxone hydrochloride may be utilized (see <a href="#Section_9">OVERDOSAGE</a>).</p>

<h2>Information for Patients/Caregivers</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Italics">The following information should be provided to patients receiving oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets by their physician, nurse, pharmacist, or caregiver:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Do not take Oxycodone and Acetaminophen Tablets if you are allergic to any of its ingredients.</li>
<li>If you develop signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">allergy</span> such as a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312437" conceptname="Dyspnea">difficulty breathing</span> stop taking Oxycodone and Acetaminophen Tablets and contact your healthcare provider immediately.</li>
<li>Do not take more than 4000 milligrams of acetaminophen per day. Call your doctor if you took more than the recommended dose.</li>
<li>Patients should be aware that oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets contain oxycodone, which is a morphine-like substance.</li>
<li>Patients should be instructed to keep oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets in a secure place out of the reach of children. In the case of accidental ingestions, emergency medical care should be sought immediately.</li>
<li>When oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets are no longer needed, the unused tablets should be destroyed by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="318566" conceptname="Flushing">flushing</span> down the toilet.</li>
<li>Patients should be advised not to adjust the medication dose themselves. Instead, they must consult with their prescribing physician.</li>
<li>Patients should be advised that oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets may impair mental and/or physical ability required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks (e.g., driving, operating heavy machinery).</li>
<li>Patients should not combine oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets with alcohol, opioid analgesics, tranquilizers, sedatives, or other CNS depressants unless under the recommendation and guidance of a physician. When co-administered with another CNS depressant, oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets can cause dangerous additive central nervous system or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>, which can result in serious injury or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>.</li>
<li>The safe use of oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets during pregnancy has not been established; thus, women who are planning to become pregnant or are pregnant should consult with their physician before taking oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets.</li>
<li>Nursing mothers should consult with their physicians about whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets because of the potential for serious adverse reactions to nursing infants.</li>
<li>Patients who are treated with oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets for more than a few weeks should be advised not to abruptly discontinue the medication.  Patients should consult with their physician for a gradual discontinuation dose schedule to taper off the medication.</li>

<h2>Laboratory Tests</h2>
<p class="First">Although oxycodone may cross-react with some drug urine tests, no available studies were found which determined the duration of detectability of oxycodone in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4215138" conceptname="Drug screening test">urine drug screens</span>.  However, based on pharmacokinetic data, the approximate duration of detectability for a single dose of oxycodone is roughly estimated to be one to two days following drug exposure.</p>
<p>Urine testing for opiates may be performed to determine illicit drug use and for medical reasons such as evaluation of patients with altered states of consciousness or monitoring efficacy of drug rehabilitation efforts. The preliminary identification of opiates in urine involves the use of an immunoassay screening and thin-layer chromatography (TLC). Gas chromatography/<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4041088" conceptname="Mass">mass</span> spectrometry (GC/MS) may be utilized as a third-stage identification step in the medical investigational sequence for opiate testing after immunoassay and TLC.  The identities of 6-keto opiates (e.g., oxycodone) can further be differentiated by the analysis of their methoxime-trimethylsilyl (MO-TMS) derivative.</p>

<h2>Drug/Drug Interactions with Oxycodone</h2>
<p class="First">Opioid analgesics may enhance the neuromuscular-blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increase in the degree of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214898" conceptname="Decreased respiratory function">respiratory depression</span>.</p>
<p>Patients receiving CNS depressants such as other opioid analgesics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, other tranquilizers, centrally-acting antiemetics, sedative-hypnotics or other CNS depressants (including alcohol) concomitantly with oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets may exhibit an additive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4171908" conceptname="Semicoma">CNS depression</span>. When such combined therapy is contemplated, the dose of one or both agents should be reduced.

<p>Agonist/antagonist analgesics (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, naltrexone, and butorphanol) should be administered with caution to a patient who has received or is receiving a pure opioid agonist such as oxycodone.   These agonist/antagonist analgesics may reduce the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesic effect</span> of oxycodone or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms.</p>

<p><span class="Bold Italics">Beta-Blockers (Propanolol):</span> Propanolol appears to inhibit the enzyme systems responsible for the glucuronidation and oxidation of acetaminophen. Therefore, the pharmacologic effects of acetaminophen may be increased.</p>
<p><span class="Bold Italics">Loop diuretics:</span> The effects of the loop diuretic may be decreased because acetaminophen may decrease renal prostaglandin excretion and decrease plasma renin activity.</p>
<p><span class="Bold Italics">Lamotrigine:</span> Serum lamotrigine concentrations may be reduced, producing a decrease in therapeutic effects.</p>
<p><span class="Bold Italics">Probenecid:</span> Probenecid may increase the therapeutic effectiveness of acetaminophen slightly.</p>
<p><span class="Bold Italics">Zidovudine:</span> The pharmacologic effects of zidovudine may be decreased because of enhanced non-hepatic or renal clearance of zidovudine.</p>

<h2>Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions</h2>
<p class="First">Depending on the sensitivity/specificity and the test methodology, the individual components of oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets may cross-react with assays used in the preliminary detection of cocaine (primary urinary metabolite, benzoylecgonine) or marijuana (cannabinoids) in human urine. A more specific alternate chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result.  The preferred confirmatory method is gas chromatography/<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4041088" conceptname="Mass">mass</span> spectrometry (GC/MS). Moreover, clinical considerations and professional judgment should be applied to any drug-of-abuse test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are used.</p>
<p>Acetaminophen may interfere with home blood glucose measurement systems; decreases of &gt; 20% in mean glucose values may be noted. This effect appears to be drug, concentration and system dependent.</p>

<h1>DRUG ABUSE AND <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">DEPENDENCE</span></h1>
<p class="First">Oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets are a Schedule II controlled substance.  Oxycodone is a mu-agonist opioid with an abuse liability similar to morphine. Oxycodone, like morphine and other opioids used in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesia</span>, can be abused and is subject to criminal diversion.</p>
<p><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440069" conceptname="Drug dependence">Drug addiction</span> is defined as an abnormal, compulsive use, use for non-medical purposes of a substance despite physical, psychological, occupational or interpersonal difficulties resulting from such use, and continued use despite harm or risk of harm. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440069" conceptname="Drug dependence">Drug addiction</span> is a treatable disease, utilizing a multidisciplinary approach, but relapse is common. Opioid addiction is relatively rare in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436096" conceptname="Chronic pain">chronic pain</span> but may be more common in individuals who have a past history of alcohol or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4279309" conceptname="Substance abuse">substance abuse</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span>. Pseudoaddiction refers to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> relief seeking behavior of patients whose <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> is poorly managed.  It is considered an iatrogenic effect of ineffective <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> management. The health care provider must assess continuously the psychological and clinical condition of a <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> patient in order to distinguish addiction from pseudoaddiction and thus, be able to treat the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> adequately.</p>
<p>Physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> on a prescribed medication does not signify addiction. Physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> involves the occurrence of a withdrawal syndrome when there is sudden reduction or cessation in drug use or if an opiate antagonist is administered. Physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> can be detected after a few days of opioid therapy. However, clinically significant physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> is only seen after several weeks of relatively high dosage therapy. In this case, abrupt discontinuation of the opioid may result in a withdrawal syndrome.  If the discontinuation of opioids is therapeutically indicated, gradual tapering of the drug over a 2-week period will prevent withdrawal symptoms. The severity of the withdrawal syndrome depends primarily on the daily dosage of the opioid, the duration of therapy and medical status of the individual.</p>
<p>The withdrawal syndrome of oxycodone is similar to that of morphine.

<p>“Drug-seeking? behavior is very common in addicts and drug abusers.  Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing or referral, repeated “loss? of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating physician(s). “Doctor Shopping? to obtain additional prescriptions is common among drug abusers and people suffering from untreated addiction.</p>
<p>Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> and tolerance. Physicians should be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4113279" conceptname="Dependence">dependence</span> in all addicts. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of true addiction and is characterized by misuse for non-medical purposes, often in combination with other psychoactive substances. Oxycodone, like other opioids, has been diverted for non-medical use. Careful recordkeeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests is strongly advised.</p>
<p>Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic reevaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs.</p>
<p>Like other opioid medications, oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets are subject to the Federal Controlled Substances Act. After chronic use, oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets should not be discontinued abruptly when it is thought that the patient has become physically dependent on oxycodone.</p>

<h3>Acetaminophen</h3>
<p class="First">Gastric decontamination with activated charcoal should be administered just prior to N-acetylcysteine (NAC) to decrease systemic absorption if acetaminophen ingestion is known or suspected to have occurred within a few hours of presentation. Serum acetaminophen levels should be obtained immediately if the patient presents 4 hours or more after ingestion to assess potential risk of hepatotoxicity; acetaminophen levels drawn less than 4 hours post-ingestion may be misleading. To obtain the best possible outcome, NAC should be administered as soon as possible where impending or evolving <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4352876" conceptname="Liver damage">liver injury</span> is suspected. Intravenous NAC may be administered when circumstances preclude oral administration.</p>
<p>Vigorous supportive therapy is required in severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">intoxication</span>. Procedures to limit the continuing absorption of the drug must be readily performed since the hepatic injury is dose dependent and occurs early in the course of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">intoxication</span>.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">Dosage should be adjusted according to the severity of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> and the response of the patient.  It may occasionally be necessary to exceed the usual dosage recommended below in cases of more severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> or in those patients who have become tolerant to the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4242687" conceptname="No sensitivity to pain">analgesic effect</span> of opioids. If <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329041" conceptname="Pain">pain</span> is constant, the opioid analgesic should be given at regular intervals on an around-the-clock schedule.
