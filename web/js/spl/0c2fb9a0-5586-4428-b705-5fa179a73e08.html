<h1>DESCRIPTION:</h1>
<p class="First">Alclometasone dipropionate ointment contains alclometasone dipropionate (7α-chloro-11β ,17,21-trihydroxy-16α -methylpregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dione 17,21-dipropionate), a synthetic corticosteroid for topical dermatologic use. The corticosteroids constitute a class of primarily synthetic steroids used topically as anti-inflammatory and antipruritic agents. Chemically, alclometasone dipropionate is C<span class="Sub">28</span>H<span class="Sub">37</span>ClO<span class="Sub">7</span>. It has the following structural formula: </p>

</div>
<p>Alclometasone dipropionate has the molecular weight of 521. It is a white powder, insoluble in water, slightly soluble in propylene glycol, and moderately soluble in hexylene glycol. Each gram of alclometasone dipropionate ointment contains 0.5 mg of alclometasone dipropionate in an ointment base of hexylene glycol, white wax, propylene glycol stearate, and white petrolatum.</p>

<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY:</h1>
<p class="First">Like other topical corticosteroids, alclometasone dipropionate has anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive properties. The mechanism of the anti-inflammatory activity of the topical steroids, in general, is unclear. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A<span class="Sub">2</span> inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4053015" conceptname="Inflammation">inflammation</span> such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor, arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A<span class="Sub">2</span>.</p>

<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetics:</span> The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors, including the vehicle and the integrity of the epidermal barrier. Occlusive dressings with hydrocortisone for up to 24 hours have not been demonstrated to increase penetration; however, occlusion of hydrocortisone for 96 hours markedly enhances penetration. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4053015" conceptname="Inflammation">Inflammation</span> and/or other disease processes in the skin may increase percutaneous absorption. A study utilizing a radiolabeled alclometasone dipropionate ointment formulation was performed to measure systemic absorption and excretion. Results indicated that approximately 3% of the steroid was absorbed during 8 hours of contact with intact skin of normal volunteers. Studies performed with alclometasone dipropionate ointment indicate that this product is in the low to medium range of potency as compared with other topical corticosteroids.</p>

<h1>INDICATIONS AND USAGE:</h1>
<p class="First">Alclometasone dipropionate ointment is a low to medium potency corticosteroid indicated for the relief of the inflammatory and pruritic manifestations of corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses. Alclometasone dipropionate ointment may be used in pediatric patients 1 year of age or older, although the safety and efficacy of drug use for longer than 3 weeks have not been established (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#s14">PRECAUTIONS: Pediatric Use</a></span>). Since the safety and efficacy of alclometasone dipropionate ointment have not been established in pediatric patients below 1 year of age, the use in this age-group is not recommended.</p>

<h1>CONTRAINDICATIONS:</h1>
<p class="First">Alclometasone dipropionate ointment is contraindicated in those patients with a history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity</span> to any of the components in these preparations.</p>

<h1>PRECAUTIONS:</h1>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34072-9">
<a name="s8"></a><a name="section-6.1"></a><p></p>
<p class="First">General: Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids can produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency after withdrawal of treatment. Manifestations of Cushing's syndrome, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4214376" conceptname="Hyperglycemia">hyperglycemia</span>, and glucosuria can also be produced in some patients by systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids while on treatment. Patients applying a topical steroid to a large surface area or to areas under occlusion should be evaluated periodically for evidence of HPA axis suppression. This may be done by using the ACTH stimulation, A.M. plasma cortisol, and urinary free cortisol tests.The effects of alclometasone dipropionate ointment on the HPA axis have been evaluated. In one study, alclometasone dipropionate ointment was applied to 30% of the body twice daily for 7 days, and occlusive dressings were used in selected patients either 12 hours or 24 hours daily. In another study, alclometasone dipropionate ointment was applied to 80% of the body surface of normal subjects twice daily for 21 days with daily 12-hour periods of whole body occlusion. Average plasma and urinary free cortisol levels and urinary levels of 17-hydroxysteroids were decreased (about 10%), suggesting suppression of the HPA axis under these conditions. Plasma cortisol levels have also been demonstrated to decrease in pediatric patients treated twice daily for 3 weeks without occlusion. If HPA axis suppression is noted, an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent corticosteroid. Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt upon discontinuation of topical corticosteroids. Infrequently, signs and symptoms of glucocorticosteroid insufficiency may occur, requiring supplemental systemic corticosteroids. For information on systemic supplementation, see prescribing information for those products. Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses due to their larger skin surface area to body <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4041088" conceptname="Mass">mass</span> ratios (see <span class="Bold"><a href="#s14">PRECAUTIONS: Pediatric Use</a></span>). If irritation develops, alclometasone dipropionate ointment should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. 
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="134438" conceptname="Contact dermatitis">Allergic contact dermatitis</span> with corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by observing a failure to heal rather than noting a clinical exacerbation, 
as with most topical products not containing corticosteroids. Such an observation should be corroborated with appropriate diagnostic patch testing. 
If concomitant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201093" conceptname="Infection of skin AND/OR subcutaneous tissue">skin infections</span> are present or develop, an appropriate antifungal or antibacterial agent should be used. 
If a favorable response does not occur promptly, 
use of alclometasone dipropionate ointment should be discontinued until the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span> has been adequately controlled.</p>
<p>
In a transgenic mouse study, chronic use of alclometasone dipropionate cream led to an increased number of animals with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4305589" conceptname="Neoplasm, benign">benign neoplasms</span> of the
skin at the treatment site 
(see <span class="Bold"><a href="#s11">PRECAUTIONS: Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility</a></span>). The clinical relevance of the findings in
animal studies to humans is not clear.

Systemic long-term animal studies have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic
potential of alclometasone dipropionate. The effects of alclometasone dipropionate on mutagenesis or fertility have not been evaluated.
</p>
<p>
In a 26-week dermal carcinogenicity study conducted in transgenic (Tg.AC) mice, topical application once daily of both the vehicle cream and the
0.05% alclometasone dipropionate cream significantly increased the incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4305589" conceptname="Neoplasm, benign">benign neoplasms</span> of the skin in both sexes at the treatment site when
compared to untreated controls. This suggests that the positive effect may be associated with the vehicle application. The clinical relevance of the

Since the safety and efficacy of alclometasone dipropionate ointment has not been established in pediatric patients below 1 year of age, its use in this age-group is not recommended. Because of a higher ratio of skin surface area to body <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4041088" conceptname="Mass">mass</span>, pediatric patients are at a greater risk than adults of HPA axis suppression and Cushing's syndrome when they are treated with topical corticosteroids.
