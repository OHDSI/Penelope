<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">Parkinson's disease is a progressive, neurodegenerative disorder of the extrapyramidal nervous system affecting the mobility and control of the skeletal muscular system. Its characteristic features include resting <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443782" conceptname="Tremor">tremor</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4050941" conceptname="Muscle rigidity">rigidity</span>, and bradykinetic movements. Symptomatic treatments, such as levodopa therapies, may permit the patient better mobility.</p>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="43679-0">
<a name="s2.1"></a><a name="section-2.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>Mechanism of Action</h2>
<p class="First">Current evidence indicates that symptoms of Parkinson's disease are related to depletion of dopamine in the corpus striatum. Administration of dopamine is ineffective in the treatment of Parkinson's disease apparently because it does not cross the blood-brain barrier. However, levodopa, the metabolic precursor of dopamine, does cross the blood-brain barrier, and presumably is converted to dopamine in the brain. This is thought to be the mechanism whereby levodopa relieves symptoms of Parkinson's disease.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="s2.2"></a><a name="section-2.2"></a><p></p>
<h2>Pharmacodynamics</h2>
<p class="First">When levodopa is administered orally, it is rapidly decarboxylated to dopamine in extracerebral tissues so that only a small portion of a given dose is transported unchanged to the central nervous system. For this reason, large doses of levodopa are required for adequate therapeutic effect, and these may often be accompanied by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span> and other adverse reactions, some of which are attributable to dopamine formed in extracerebral tissues.</p>
<p>Since levodopa competes with certain amino acids for transport across the gut wall, the absorption of levodopa may be impaired in some patients on a high protein diet.</p>
<p>Carbidopa inhibits decarboxylation of peripheral levodopa. It does not cross the blood-brain barrier and does not affect the metabolism of levodopa within the central nervous system.</p>
<p>The incidence of levodopa-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span> is less with carbidopa and levodopa tablets than with levodopa. In many patients, this reduction in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span> will permit more rapid dosage titration.</p>
<p>Since its decarboxylase inhibiting activity is limited to extracerebral tissues, administration of carbidopa with levodopa makes more levodopa available for transport to the brain.</p>

<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="43682-4">
<a name="s2.3"></a><a name="section-2.3"></a><p></p>
<h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
<p class="First">Carbidopa reduces the amount of levodopa required to produce a given response by about 75% and, when administered with levodopa, increases both plasma levels and the plasma half-life of levodopa, and decreases plasma and urinary dopamine and homovanillic acid.</p>
<p>The plasma half-life of levodopa is about 50 minutes, without carbidopa. When carbidopa and levodopa are administered together, the half-life of levodopa is increased to about 1.5 hours. At steady state, the bioavailability of carbidopa from carbidopa and levodopa tablets is approximately 99% relative to the concomitant administration of carbidopa and levodopa.</p>
<p>In clinical pharmacologic studies, simultaneous administration of carbidopa and levodopa produced greater urinary excretion of levodopa in proportion to the excretion of dopamine than administration of the two drugs at separate times.</p>
<p>Pyridoxine hydrochloride (vitamin B<span class="Sub">6</span>), in oral doses of 10 mg to 25 mg, may reverse the effects of levodopa by increasing the rate of aromatic amino acid decarboxylation. Carbidopa inhibits this action of pyridoxine; therefore, carbidopa and levodopa tablets can be given to patients receiving supplemental pyridoxine (vitamin B<span class="Sub">6</span>).</p>

<h1>INDICATIONS AND USAGE</h1>
<p class="First">Carbidopa and levodopa tablets are indicated in the treatment of the symptoms of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440377" conceptname="Paralysis">paralysis</span> agitans), post-encephalitic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4140090" conceptname="Parkinsonism">parkinsonism</span>, and symptomatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4140090" conceptname="Parkinsonism">parkinsonism</span> which may follow injury to the nervous system by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4198996" conceptname="Carbon monoxide">carbon monoxide</span> <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">intoxication</span> and/or manganese <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">intoxication</span>.</p>
<p>Carbidopa and levodopa tablets are indicated in these conditions to permit the administration of lower doses of levodopa with reduced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, with more rapid dosage titration, with a somewhat smoother response, and with supplemental pyridoxine (vitamin B<span class="Sub">6</span>).</p>
<p>In some patients a somewhat smoother antiparkinsonian effect results from therapy with carbidopa and levodopa tablets than with levodopa. However, patients with markedly irregular ("on-off") responses to levodopa have not been shown to benefit from carbidopa and levodopa tablets.</p>
<p>Although the administration of carbidopa permits control of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4140090" conceptname="Parkinsonism">parkinsonism</span> and Parkinson's disease with much lower doses of levodopa, there is no conclusive evidence at present that this is beneficial other than in reducing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, permitting more rapid titration, and providing a somewhat smoother response to levodopa.</p>
<p>Certain patients who responded poorly to levodopa have improved when carbidopa and levodopa tablets were substituted. This is most likely due to decreased peripheral decarboxylation of levodopa which results from administration of carbidopa rather than to a primary effect of carbidopa on the nervous system. Carbidopa has not been shown to enhance the intrinsic efficacy of levodopa in parkinsonian syndromes.</p>
<p>In considering whether to give carbidopa and levodopa tablets to patients already on levodopa who have <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span> and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>, the practitioner should be aware that, while many patients may be expected to improve, some do not. Since one cannot predict which patients are likely to improve, this can only be determined by a trial of therapy. It should be further noted that in controlled trials comparing carbidopa and levodopa tablets with levodopa, about half of the patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span> and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span> on levodopa improved spontaneously despite being retained on the same dose of levodopa during the controlled portion of the trial.</p>

<h1>CONTRAINDICATIONS</h1>
<p class="First">Nonselective monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors are contraindicated for use with carbidopa and levodopa tablets. These inhibitors must be discontinued at least two weeks prior to initiating therapy with carbidopa and levodopa tablets. Carbidopa and levodopa tablets may be administered concomitantly with the manufacturer's recommended dose of an MAO inhibitor with selectivity for MAO type B (e.g., selegiline HCl) (see <a href="#s6.5">PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions</a>).</p>
<p>Carbidopa and levodopa tablets are contraindicated in patients with known <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity</span> to any component of this drug, and in patients with narrow-angle <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437541" conceptname="Glaucoma">glaucoma</span>.</p>
<p>Because levodopa may activate a malignant melanoma, carbidopa and levodopa tablets should not be used in patients with suspicious, undiagnosed <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4316083" conceptname="Skin lesion">skin lesions</span> or a history of melanoma.</p>

<h1>WARNINGS</h1>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">When carbidopa and levodopa tablets are to be given to patients who are being treated with levodopa, levodopa must be discontinued at least twelve hours before therapy with carbidopa and levodopa tablets is started. In order to reduce adverse reactions, it is necessary to individualize therapy. See <a href="#s9">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</a> section before initiating therapy</span>.</p>
<p>The addition of carbidopa with levodopa in the form of carbidopa and levodopa tablets reduces the peripheral effects (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>) due to decarboxylation of levodopa; however, carbidopa does not decrease the adverse reactions due to the central effects of levodopa. Because carbidopa permits more levodopa to reach the brain and more dopamine to be formed, certain adverse CNS effects, e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4047115" conceptname="Oral dyskinesia">dyskinesias</span> (involuntary movements), may occur at lower dosages and sooner with carbidopa and levodopa tablets than with levodopa alone.</p>
<p>Levodopa alone, as well as carbidopa and levodopa tablets, is associated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4047115" conceptname="Oral dyskinesia">dyskinesias</span>. The occurrence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4047115" conceptname="Oral dyskinesia">dyskinesias</span> may require dosage reduction.</p>
<p>As with levodopa, carbidopa and levodopa tablets may cause mental disturbances. These reactions are thought to be due to increased brain dopamine following administration of levodopa. All patients should be observed carefully for the development of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> with concomitant suicidal tendencies. Patients with past or current psychoses should be treated with caution.</p>
<p>Carbidopa and levodopa should be administered cautiously to patients with severe cardiovascular or pulmonary disease, bronchial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317009" conceptname="Asthma">asthma</span>, renal, hepatic or endocrine disease.</p>
<p>As with levodopa, care should be exercised in administering carbidopa and levodopa tablets to patients with a history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span> who have residual atrial, nodal, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4185572" conceptname="Ventricular arrhythmia">ventricular arrhythmias</span>. In such patients, cardiac function should be monitored with particular care during the period of initial dosage adjustment, in a facility with provisions for intensive cardiac care.</p>
<p>As with levodopa, treatment with carbidopa and levodopa tablets may increase the possibility of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4291649" conceptname="Upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage">upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage</span> in patients with a history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4027663" conceptname="Peptic ulcer">peptic ulcer</span>.</p>

<h2></h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="379802" conceptname="Neuroleptic malignant syndrome">Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome</span> (NMS):</span> Sporadic cases of a symptom complex resembling NMS have been reported in association with dose reductions or withdrawal of therapy with carbidopa and levodopa tablets. Therefore, patients should be observed carefully when the dosage of carbidopa and levodopa is reduced abruptly or discontinued, especially if the patient is receiving neuroleptics.</p>
<p>NMS is an uncommon but life-threatening syndrome characterized by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">fever</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4178904" conceptname="Body temperature above reference range">hyperthermia</span>. Neurological findings, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4050941" conceptname="Muscle rigidity">muscle rigidity</span>, involuntary movements, altered consciousness, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436222" conceptname="Altered mental status">mental status changes</span>; other disturbances, such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="434633" conceptname="Disorder of autonomic nervous system">autonomic dysfunction</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">tachycardia</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317376" conceptname="Tachypnea">tachypnea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138565" conceptname="Hyperhidrosis">sweating</span>, hyper- or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>; laboratory findings, such as creatine phosphokinase elevation, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438398" conceptname="Leukocytosis">leukocytosis</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439142" conceptname="Myoglobinuria">myoglobinuria</span>, and increased serum myoglobin have been reported.</p>
<p>The early diagnosis of this condition is important for the appropriate management of these patients. Considering NMS as a possible diagnosis and ruling out other acute illnesses (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="255848" conceptname="Pneumonia">pneumonia</span>, systemic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432250" conceptname="Infectious disease">infection</span>, etc.) is essential. This may be especially complex if the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4181404" conceptname="Heat stroke">heat stroke</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437663" conceptname="Fever">drug fever</span>, and primary central nervous system (CNS) pathology.</p>
<p>The management of NMS should include: 1) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring and 2) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. Dopamine agonists, such as bromocriptine, and muscle relaxants, such as dantrolene, are often used in the treatment of NMS, however, their effectiveness has not been demonstrated in controlled studies.</p>

<h1>PRECAUTIONS</h1>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34072-9">
<a name="s6.1"></a><a name="section-6.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>General</h2>
<p class="First">As with levodopa, periodic evaluations of hepatic, hematopoietic, cardiovascular, and renal function are recommended during extended therapy.</p>
<p>Patients with chronic wide-angle <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437541" conceptname="Glaucoma">glaucoma</span> may be treated cautiously with carbidopa and levodopa provided the intraocular pressure is well-controlled and the patient is monitored carefully for changes in intraocular pressure during therapy.</p>
<p>Dopaminergic agents, including levodopa, may be associated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span> and very rarely episodes of sudden onset of sleep. In some cases, these episodes may occur without awareness or warning during daily activities. Patients must be informed of this and advised to exercise caution while driving or operating machines while being treated with dopaminergic agents, including levodopa. Patients who have experienced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span> and/or an episode of sudden sleep onset must refrain from driving or operating machines (see <span class="Italics"><a href="#s6.3">Information for Patients)</a></span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34072-9">
<a name="s6.2"></a><a name="section-6.2"></a><p></p>
<h2>Melanoma</h2>
<p class="First">Epidemiological studies have shown that patients with Parkinson’s disease have a higher risk (2- to approximately 6-fold higher) of developing melanoma than the general population. Whether the increased risk observed was due to Parkinson’s disease or other factors, such as drugs used to treat Parkinson’s disease, is unclear.</p>
<p>For the reasons stated above, patients and providers are advised to monitor for melanomas frequently and on a regular basis when using carbidopa and levodopa tablets for any indication. Ideally, periodic skin examinations should be performed by appropriately qualified individuals (e.g., dermatologists).</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34076-0">
<a name="s6.3"></a><a name="section-6.3"></a><p></p>
<h2>Information for Patients</h2>
<p class="First">The patient should be informed that carbidopa and levodopa tablet is an immediate-release formulation of carbidopa and levodopa that is designed to begin release of ingredients within 30 minutes. It is important that carbidopa and levodopa tablets be taken at regular intervals according to the schedule outlined by the physician. The patient should be cautioned not to change the prescribed dosage regimen and not to add any additional antiparkinson medications, including other carbidopa and levodopa preparations, without first consulting the physician.</p>
<p>Patients should be advised that sometimes a 'wearing-off' effect may occur at the end of the dosing interval. The physician should be notified if such response poses a problem to lifestyle.</p>
<p>Patients should be advised that occasionally, dark color (red, brown, or black) may appear in saliva, urine, or sweat after ingestion of carbidopa and levodopa tablets. Although the color appears to be clinically insignificant, garments may become discolored.</p>
<p>The patient should be advised that a change in diet to foods that are high in protein may delay the absorption of levodopa and may reduce the amount taken up in the circulation. Excessive acidity also delays stomach emptying, thus delaying the absorption of levodopa. Iron salts (such as in multivitamin tablets) may also reduce the amount of levodopa available to the body. The above factors may reduce the clinical effectiveness of the levodopa or carbidopa and levodopa therapy.</p>
<p>Patients should be alerted to the possibility of sudden onset of sleep during daily activities, in some cases without awareness or warning signs, when they are taking dopaminergic agents, including levodopa. Patients should be advised to exercise caution while driving or operating machinery and that if they have experienced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span> and/or sudden sleep onset, they must refrain from these activities. (See <a href="#s6.1">PRECAUTIONS: General</a>.)</p>
<p>There have been reports of patients experiencing intense urges to gamble, increased sexual urges, and other intense urges, and the inability to control these urges while taking one or more of the medications that increase central dopaminergic tone and that are generally used for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease, including carbidopa and levodopa tablets. Although it is not proven that the medications caused these events, these urges were reported to have stopped in some cases when the dose was reduced or the medication was stopped. Prescribers should ask patients about the development of new or increased <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4023166" conceptname="Gambling">gambling</span> urges, sexual urges or other urges while being treated with carbidopa and levodopa tablets. Patients should inform their physician if they experience new or increased <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4023166" conceptname="Gambling">gambling</span> urges, increased sexual urges, or other intense urges while taking carbidopa and levodopa tablets. Physicians should consider dose reduction or stopping the medication if a patient develops such urges while taking carbidopa and levodopa tablets.</p>

<a name="s6.4"></a><a name="section-6.4"></a><p></p>
<h2>Laboratory Tests</h2>
<p class="First">Abnormalities in laboratory tests may include elevations of liver function tests such as alkaline phosphatase, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4094657" conceptname="Aspartate aminotransferase">SGOT</span> (AST), SGPT (ALT), lactic dehydrogenase, and bilirubin. Abnormalities in blood urea nitrogen and positive Coombs test have also been reported. Commonly, levels of blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and uric acid are lower during administration of carbidopa and levodopa than with levodopa.</p>
<p>Carbidopa and levodopa may cause a false-positive reaction for urinary <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4017413" conceptname="Acetoacetate">ketone bodies</span> when a test tape is used for determination of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4171926" conceptname="Ketonuria">ketonuria</span>. This reaction will not be altered by boiling the urine specimen. False-negative tests may result with the use of glucose-oxidase methods of testing for glucosuria.</p>
<p>Cases of falsely diagnosed <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4118993" conceptname="Pheochromocytoma">pheochromocytoma</span> in patients on carbidopa and levodopa therapy have been reported very rarely. Caution should be exercised when interpreting the plasma and urine levels of catecholamines and their metabolites in patients on levodopa or carbidopa and levodopa therapy.</p>

<h2>Drug Interactions</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Italics">Caution should be exercised when the following drugs are administered concomitantly with carbidopa and levodopa tablets.</span></p>
<p>Symptomatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319041" conceptname="Orthostatic hypotension">postural hypotension</span> occurred when carbidopa and levodopa was added to the treatment of a patient receiving antihypertensive drugs. Therefore, when therapy with carbidopa and levodopa is started, dosage adjustment of the antihypertensive drug may be required.</p>
<p>For patients receiving MAO inhibitors (Type A or B), see <a href="#s4">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a>. Concomitant therapy with selegiline and carbidopa and levodopa may be associated with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319041" conceptname="Orthostatic hypotension">orthostatic hypotension</span> not attributable to carbidopa and levodopa alone [See <a href="#s4">CONTRAINDICATIONS</a>].</p>
<p>There have been rare reports of adverse reactions, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316866" conceptname="Hypertensive disorder">hypertension</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4047115" conceptname="Oral dyskinesia">dyskinesia</span>, resulting from the concomitant use of tricyclic antidepressants and carbidopa and levodopa.</p>
<p>Dopamine D<span class="Sub">2</span> receptor antagonists (e.g., phenothiazines, butyrophenones, risperidone) and isoniazid may reduce the therapeutic effects of levodopa. In addition, the beneficial effects of levodopa in Parkinson's disease have been reported to be reversed by phenytoin and papaverine. Patients taking these drugs with carbidopa and levodopa should be carefully observed for loss of therapeutic response.</p>
<p>Iron salts may reduce the bioavailability of levodopa and carbidopa. The clinical relevance is unclear.</p>
<p>Although metoclopramide may increase the bioavailability of levodopa by increasing gastric emptying, metoclopramide may also adversely affect disease control by its dopamine receptor antagonistic properties.</p>

<h2>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h2>
<p class="First">In a two-year bioassay of carbidopa and levodopa, no evidence of carcinogenicity was found in rats receiving doses of approximately two times the maximum daily human dose of carbidopa and four times the maximum daily human dose of levodopa.</p>
<p>In reproduction studies with carbidopa and levodopa tablets, no effects on fertility were found in rats receiving doses of approximately two times the maximum daily human dose of carbidopa and four times the maximum daily human dose of levodopa.</p>

<p class="First"><span class="Italics">Pregnancy Category C.</span> No teratogenic effects were observed in a study in mice receiving up to 20 times the maximum recommended human dose of carbidopa and levodopa tablets. There was a decrease in the number of live pups delivered by rats receiving approximately two times the maximum recommended human dose of carbidopa and approximately five times the maximum recommended human dose of levodopa during organogenesis. Carbidopa and levodopa tablets caused both visceral and skeletal malformations in rabbits at all doses and ratios of carbidopa/levodopa tested, which ranged from 10 times/5 times the maximum recommended human dose of carbidopa/levodopa to 20 times/10 times the maximum recommended human dose of carbidopa/levodopa.</p>
<p>There are no adequate or well-controlled studies in pregnant women. It has been reported from individual cases that levodopa crosses the human placental barrier, enters the fetus, and is metabolized. Carbidopa concentrations in fetal tissue appeared to be minimal. Use of carbidopa and levodopa tablets in women of childbearing potential requires that the anticipated benefits of the drug be weighed against possible hazards to mother and child.</p>

<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<p class="First">Management of acute overdosage with carbidopa and levodopa tablets is the same as management of acute overdosage with levodopa. Pyridoxine is not effective in reversing the actions of carbidopa and levodopa tablets.</p>
<p>General supportive measures should be employed, along with immediate gastric lavage. Intravenous fluids should be administered judiciously and an adequate airway maintained. Electrocardiographic monitoring should be instituted and the patient carefully observed for the development of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmias</span>; if required, appropriate antiarrhythmic therapy should be given. The possibility that the patient may have taken other drugs as well as carbidopa and levodopa tablets should be taken into consideration. To date, no experience has been reported with dialysis; hence, its value in overdosage is not known.</p>
<p>Based on studies in which high doses of levodopa and/or carbidopa were administered, a significant proportion of rats and mice given single oral doses of levodopa of approximately 1500 to 2000 mg/kg are expected to die. A significant proportion of infant rats of both sexes are expected to die at a dose of 800 mg/kg. A significant proportion of rats are expected to die after treatment with similar doses of carbidopa. The addition of carbidopa in a 1:10 ratio with levodopa increases the dose at which a significant proportion of mice are expected to die to 3360 mg/kg.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34068-7">
<a name="s9"></a><a name="section-9"></a><p></p>
<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">The optimum daily dosage of carbidopa and levodopa must be determined by careful titration in each patient. Carbidopa and levodopa tablets are available in a 1:4 ratio of carbidopa to levodopa (carbidopa and levodopa tablets 25 mg/100 mg) as well as 1:10 ratio (carbidopa and levodopa tablets 25 mg/250 mg and carbidopa and levodopa tablets 10 mg/100 mg). Tablets of the two ratios may be given separately or combined as needed to provide the optimum dosage.</p>
<p>Studies show that peripheral dopa decarboxylase is saturated by carbidopa at approximately 70 to 100 mg a day. Patients receiving less than this amount of carbidopa are more likely to experience <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">vomiting</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Usual Initial Dosage</span><br>Dosage is best initiated with one tablet of carbidopa and levodopa tablets 25 mg/100 mg three times a day. This dosage schedule provides 75 mg of carbidopa per day. Dosage may be increased by one tablet every day or every other day, as necessary, until a dosage of eight tablets of carbidopa and levodopa tablets 25 mg/100 mg a day is reached.</p>
<p>If carbidopa and levodopa tablets 10 mg/100 mg are used, dosage may be initiated with one tablet three or four times a day. However, this will not provide an adequate amount of carbidopa for many patients. Dosage may be increased by one tablet every day or every other day until a total of eight tablets (2 tablets q.i.d.) is reached.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">How to Transfer Patients from Levodopa</span><br><span class="Bold">Levodopa must be discontinued at least twelve hours before starting carbidopa and levodopa tablets.</span> A daily dosage of carbidopa and levodopa should be chosen that will provide approximately 25% of the previous levodopa dosage. Patients who are taking less than 1500 mg of levodopa a day should be started on one tablet of carbidopa and levodopa 25 mg/100 mg three or four times a day. The suggested starting dosage for most patients taking more than 1500 mg of levodopa is one tablet of carbidopa and levodopa 25 mg/250 mg three or four times a day.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Maintenance</span><br>Therapy should be individualized and adjusted according to the desired therapeutic response. At least 70 to 100 mg of carbidopa per day should be provided. When a greater proportion of carbidopa is required, one tablet of carbidopa and levodopa 25 mg/100 mg may be substituted for each tablet of carbidopa and levodopa 10 mg/100 mg. When more levodopa is required, carbidopa and levodopa tablets 25 mg/250 mg should be substituted for carbidopa and levodopa tablets 25 mg/100 mg or carbidopa and levodopa tablets 10 mg/100 mg. If necessary, the dosage of carbidopa and levodopa tablets 25 mg/250 mg may be increased by one-half or one tablet every day or every other day to a maximum of eight tablets a day. Experience with total daily dosages of carbidopa greater than 200 mg is limited.</p>
<p>Because both therapeutic and adverse responses occur more rapidly with carbidopa and levodopa than with levodopa alone, patients should be monitored closely during the dose adjustment period. Specifically, involuntary movements will occur more rapidly with carbidopa and levodopa than with levodopa. The occurrence of involuntary movements may require dosage reduction. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435802" conceptname="Blepharospasm">Blepharospasm</span> may be a useful early sign of excess dosage in some patients.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Addition of Other Antiparkinsonian Medications</span><br>Standard drugs for Parkinson's disease, other than levodopa without a decarboxylase inhibitor, may be used concomitantly while carbidopa and levodopa tablets are being administered, although dosage adjustments may be required.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">Interruption of Therapy</span><br>Sporadic cases of a symptom complex resembling <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="379802" conceptname="Neuroleptic malignant syndrome">Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome</span> (NMS) have been associated with dose reductions and withdrawal of carbidopa and levodopa tablets. Patients should be observed carefully if abrupt reduction or discontinuation of carbidopa and levodopa tablets is required, especially if the patient is receiving neuroleptics (See <a href="#s5">WARNINGS</a>).</p>
<p>If general anesthesia is required, carbidopa and levodopa may be continued as long as the patient is permitted to take fluids and medication by mouth. If therapy is interrupted temporarily, the patient should be observed for symptoms resembling NMS, and the usual daily dosage may be administered as soon as the patient is able to take oral medication.</p>
