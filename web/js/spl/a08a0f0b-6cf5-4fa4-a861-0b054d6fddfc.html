<h2>Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism</h2>
<p class="First">The absolute <span class="Bold">bioavailability </span>of quinidine from quinidine gluconate is 70 to 80%. Relative to a solution of quinidine sulfate, the bioavailability of quinidine from quinidine gluconate is reported to be 1.03. The less-than-complete bioavailability is thought to be due to first-pass elimination by the liver. Peak serum levels generally appear 3 to 5 hours after dosing; when the drug is taken with food, absorption is increased in both rate (27%) and extent (17%). The rate and extent of absorption of quinidine from quinidine gluconate are not significantly affected by the coadministration of an aluminum-hydroxide antacid. The rate of absorption of quinidine following the ingestion of grapefruit juice may be decreased.</p>
<p>The <span class="Bold">volume of distribution </span>of quinidine is 2 to 3 L/kg in healthy young adults, but this may be reduced to as little as 0.5 L/kg in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319835" conceptname="Congestive heart failure">congestive heart failure</span>, or increased to 3 to 5 L/kg in patients with cirrhosis of the liver. At concentrations of 2 to 5 mg/L (6.5 to 16.2 Âµmol/L), the fraction of quinidine bound to plasma proteins (mainly to Î±<span class="Sub">1</span>-acid glycoprotein and to albumin) is 80 to 88% in adults and older children, but it is lower in pregnant women, and in infants and neonates it may be as low as 50 to 70%. Because Î±<span class="Sub">1</span>-acid glycoprotein levels are increased in response to stress, serum levels of total quinidine may be greatly increased in settings such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312327" conceptname="Acute myocardial infarction">acute myocardial infarction</span>, even though the serum content of unbound (active) drug may remain normal. Protein binding is also increased in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="198185" conceptname="Chronic renal failure">chronic renal failure</span>, but binding abruptly descends toward or below normal when heparin is administered for hemodialysis.</p>
<p>Quinidine <span class="Bold">clearance </span>typically proceeds at 3 to 5 mL/min/kg in adults, but clearance in children may be twice or three times as rapid. The elimination half-life is 6 to 8 hours in adults and 3 to 4 hours in children. Quinidine clearance is unaffected by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4064161" conceptname="Cirrhosis of liver">hepatic cirrhosis</span>, so the increased volume of distribution seen in cirrhosis leads to a proportionate increase in the elimination half-life.</p>
<p>Most quinidine is eliminated hepatically via the action of cytochrome P450IIIA4; there are several different hydroxylated metabolites, and some of these have antiarrhythmic activity.</p>
<p>The most important of quinidineâ€™s metabolites is 3-hydroxy-quinidine (3HQ), serum levels of which can approach those of quinidine in patients receiving conventional doses of quinidine gluconate. The volume of distribution of 3HQ appears to be larger than that of quinidine, and the elimination half-life of 3HQ is about 12 hours.</p>
<p>As measured by antiarrhythmic effects on animals, by QT<span class="Sub">c</span> prolongation in human volunteers, or by various <span class="Italics">in vitro </span>techniques, 3HQ has at least half the antiarrhythmic activity of the parent compound, so it may be responsible for a substantial fraction of the effect of quinidine gluconate in chronic use.</p>
<p>When the urine pH is less than 7, about 20% of administered quinidine appears unchanged in the urine, but this fraction drops to as little as 5% when the urine is more alkaline. Renal clearance involves both glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion, moderated by (pH-dependent) tubular reabsorption. The net renal clearance is about 1 mL/min/kg in healthy adults.</p>
<p>When renal function is taken into account, quinidine clearance is apparently independent of patient age.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Assays </span>of serum quinidine levels are widely available, but the results of modern assays may not be consistent with results cited in the older medical literature. The serum levels of quinidine cited in this package insert are those derived from specific assays, using either benzene extraction or (preferably) reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography. In matched samples, older assays might unpredictably have given results that were as much as two or three times higher. A typical â€œtherapeuticâ€? concentration range is 2 to 6 mg/L (6.2 to 18.5 Âµmol/L).</p>

<h2>Mechanisms of Action</h2>
<p class="First">In patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438067" conceptname="Malaria">malaria</span>, quinidine acts primarily as an intra-erythrocytic schizonticide, with little effect upon sporozites or upon pre-erythrocytic parasites. Quinidine is gametocidal to <span class="Italics">Plasmodium vivax </span>and <span class="Italics">P. malariae, </span>but not to <span class="Italics">P. falciparum.</span></p>
<p>In cardiac muscle and in Purkinje fibers, quinidine depresses the rapid inward depolarizing sodium current, thereby slowing phase-0 depolarization and reducing the amplitude of the action potential without affecting the resting potential. In normal Purkinje fibers, it reduces the slope of phase-4 depolarization, shifting the threshold voltage upward toward zero. The result is slowed conduction and reduced automaticity in all parts of the heart, with increase of the effective refractory period relative to the duration of the action potential in the atria, ventricles, and Purkinje tissues. Quinidine also raises the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4226399" conceptname="Fibrillation">fibrillation</span> thresholds of the atria and ventricles, and it raises the ventricular <span class="Italics">de</span><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4226399" conceptname="Fibrillation">fibrillation</span> threshold as well. Quinidineâ€™s actions <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">fall</span> into Class Ia in the Vaughn-Williams classification.</p>
<p>By slowing conduction and prolonging the effective refractory period, quinidine can interrupt or prevent reentrant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmias</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmias</span> due to increased automaticity, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="314665" conceptname="Atrial flutter">atrial flutter</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="313217" conceptname="Atrial fibrillation">atrial fibrillation</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317893" conceptname="Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia">paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia</span>.</p>
<p>In patients with the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317302" conceptname="Sinus node dysfunction">sick sinus syndrome</span>, quinidine can cause marked sinus node <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="438727" conceptname="Atypical depressive disorder">depression</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169095" conceptname="Bradycardia">bradycardia</span>. In most patients, however, use of quinidine is associated with an increase in the sinus rate.</p>
<p>Like other antiarrhythmic drugs with Class Ia activity, quinidine prolongs the QT interval in a dose-related fashion. This may lead to increased ventricular automaticity and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4103295" conceptname="Ventricular tachycardia">polymorphic ventricular tachycardias</span>, including <span class="Italics"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4135823" conceptname="Torsades de pointes">torsades de pointes</span> </span>(see<span class="Bold"><a href="#A387EFB7-ED70-4EA8-9936-8DBEDC523319">WARNINGS</a></span>).</p>
<p>In addition, quinidine has anticholinergic activity, it has negative inotropic activity, and it acts peripherally as an Î±-adrenergic antagonist (that is, as a vasodilator).</p>

<h2>Maintenance of Sinus Rhythm After Conversion From <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="313217" conceptname="Atrial fibrillation">Atrial Fibrillation</span></h2>
<p class="First">In six clinical trials (published between 1970 and 1984) with a total of 808 patients, quinidine (418 patients) was compared to nontreatment (258 patients) or placebo (132 patients) for the maintenance of sinus rhythm after cardioversion from <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="313217" conceptname="Atrial fibrillation">chronic atrial fibrillation</span>. Quinidine was consistently more efficacious in maintaining sinus rhythm, but a meta-analysis found that mortality in the quinidine-exposed patients (2.9%) was significantly greater than mortality in the patients who had not been treated with active drug (0.8%).</p>
<p>Suppression of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="313217" conceptname="Atrial fibrillation">atrial fibrillation</span> with quinidine has theoretical patient benefits (e.g., improved exercise tolerance; reduction in hospitalization for cardioversion; lack of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">arrhythmia</span>-related <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315078" conceptname="Palpitations">palpitations</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312437" conceptname="Dyspnea">dyspnea</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="77670" conceptname="Chest pain">chest pain</span>; reduced incidence of systemic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4185607" conceptname="Embolism">embolism</span> and/or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span>), but these benefits have never been demonstrated in clinical trials. Some of these benefits (e.g., reduction in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="381316" conceptname="Cerebrovascular accident">stroke</span> incidence) may be achievable by other means (anticoagulation).</p>

<h2>Non-Life-Threatening <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4185572" conceptname="Ventricular arrhythmia">Ventricular Arrhythmias</span></h2>
<p class="First">In studies of patients with a variety of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4185572" conceptname="Ventricular arrhythmia">ventricular arrhythmias</span> (mainly frequent ventricular <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316429" conceptname="Premature beats">premature beats</span> and non-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4103295" conceptname="Ventricular tachycardia">sustained ventricular tachycardia</span>, quinidine (total n=502) has been compared with flecainide (n=141), mexiletine (n=246), propafenone (n=53), and tocainide (n=67). In each of these studies, the mortality in the quinidine group was numerically greater than the mortality in the comparator group. When the studies were combined in a meta-analysis, quinidine was associated with a statistically significant threefold relative risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span>.</p>
<p>At therapeutic doses, quinidineâ€™s only consistent effect upon the surface electrocardiogram is an increase in the QT interval. This prolongation can be monitored as a guide to safety, and it may provide better guidance than serum drug levels (see<span class="Bold"><a href="#A387EFB7-ED70-4EA8-9936-8DBEDC523319">WARNINGS</a></span>).</p>

<h2>Reduction of Frequency of Relapse into <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="313217" conceptname="Atrial fibrillation">Atrial Fibrillation</span>/Flutter</h2>
<p class="First">Chronic therapy with quinidine gluconate is indicated for some patients at high risk of symptomatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="313217" conceptname="Atrial fibrillation">atrial fibrillation</span>/flutter, generally patients who have had previous episodes of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="313217" conceptname="Atrial fibrillation">atrial fibrillation</span>/flutter that were so frequent and poorly tolerated as to outweigh, in the judgment of the physician and the patient, the risks of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4118659" conceptname="Prophylactic">prophylactic</span> therapy with quinidine gluconate. The increased risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> should specifically be considered. Quinidine gluconate should be used only after alternative measures (e.g., use of other drugs to control the ventricular rate) have been found to be inadequate.</p>
<p>In patients with histories of frequent symptomatic episodes of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="313217" conceptname="Atrial fibrillation">atrial fibrillation</span>/flutter, the goal of therapy should be an increase in the average time between episodes.

Because of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">proarrhythmic effects</span> of quinidine, its use with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4185572" conceptname="Ventricular arrhythmia">ventricular arrhythmias</span> of lesser severity is generally not recommended, and treatment of patients with asymptomatic ventricular premature contractions should be avoided.

<h2>Pharmacokinetic Considerations</h2>
<p class="First">Renal or hepatic dysfunction causes the elimination of quinidine to be slowed, while <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319835" conceptname="Congestive heart failure">congestive heart failure</span> causes a reduction in quinidineâ€™s apparent volume of distribution. Any of these conditions can lead to quinidine toxicity if dosage is not appropriately reduced. In addition, interactions with coadministered drugs can alter the serum concentration and activity of quinidine, leading either to toxicity or to lack of efficacy if the dose of quinidine is not appropriately modified.

<h2>Drug and Diet Interactions</h2>
<div class="Section">
<a name="section-8.2.1"></a><p></p>
<h3>Altered Pharmacokinetics of Quinidine</h3>
<p class="First">Diltiazem significantly decreases the clearance and increases the t<span class="Sub">1/2</span> of quinidine, but quinidine does not alter the kinetics of diltiazem.</p>
<p>Drugs that alkalinize the urine (<span class="Bold">carbonic-anhydrase inhibitors, sodium <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4285456" conceptname="Bicarbonate">bicarbonate</span>, thiazide diuretics</span>) reduce renal elimination of quinidine.</p>
<p>By pharmacokinetic mechanisms that are not well understood, quinidine levels are increased by coadministration of <span class="Bold">amiodarone </span>or <span class="Bold">cimetidine. </span>Very rarely, and again by mechanisms not understood, quinidine levels are decreased by coadministration of <span class="Bold">nifedipine.</span></p>
<p>Hepatic elimination of quinidine may be accelerated by coadministration of drugs (<span class="Bold">phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampin</span>) that induce production of cytochrome P450IIIA4.</p>
<p>Perhaps because of competition for the P450IIIA4 metabolic pathway, quinidine levels rise when <span class="Bold">ketoconazole </span>is coadministered.</p>
<p>Coadministration of <span class="Bold">propranolol </span>usually does not affect quinidine pharmacokinetics, but in some studies the ÃŸ-blocker appeared to cause increases in the peak serum levels of quinidine, decreases in quinidineâ€™s volume of distribution, and decreases in total quinidine clearance. The effects (if any) of coadministration of <span class="Bold">other ÃŸ-blockers </span>on quinidine pharmacokinetics have not been adequately studied.</p>
<p>Hepatic clearance of quinidine is significantly reduced during coadministration of <span class="Bold">verapamil, </span>with corresponding increases in serum levels and half-life.</p>
<p><span class="Underline">Grapefruit juice</span></p>
<p>Grapefruit juice inhibits P450 3A4-mediated metabolism of quinidine to 3-hydroxyquinidine. Although the clinical significance of this interaction is unknown, grapefruit juice should be avoided.</p>
<p><span class="Underline">Dietary salt</span></p>
<p>The rate and extent of quinidine absorption may be affected by changes in dietary salt intake; a decrease in dietary salt intake may lead to an increase in plasma quinidine concentrations.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section">
<a name="section-8.2.2"></a><p></p>
<h3>Altered Pharmacokinetics of Other Drugs</h3>
<p class="First">Quinidine slows the elimination of <span class="Bold">digoxin </span>and simultaneously reduces digoxinâ€™s apparent volume of distribution. As a result, serum digoxin levels may be as much as doubled. When quinidine and digoxin are coadministered, digoxin doses usually need to be reduced. Serum levels of <span class="Bold">digitoxin </span>are also raised when quinidine is coadministered, although the effect appears to be smaller.</p>
<p>By a mechanism that is not understood, quinidine potentiates the anticoagulatory action of <span class="Bold">warfarin, </span>and the anticoagulant dosage may need to be reduced.</p>
<p>Cytochrome P450IID6 is an enzyme critical to the metabolism of many drugs, notably including <span class="Bold">mexiletine, </span>some <span class="Bold">phenothiazines, </span>and most <span class="Bold">polycyclic antidepressants. </span>Constitutional deficiency of cytochrome P450IID6 is found in less than 1% of Orientals, in about 2% of American blacks, and in about 8% of American whites. Testing with debrisoquine is sometimes used to distinguish the P450IID6- deficient â€œpoor metabolizersâ€? from the majority-phenotype â€œextensive metabolizersâ€?.</p>
<p>When drugs whose metabolism is P450IID6-dependent are given to poor metabolizers, the serum levels achieved are higher, sometimes much higher, than the serum levels achieved when identical doses are given to extensive metabolizers. To obtain similar clinical benefit without toxicity, doses given to poor metabolizers may need to be greatly reduced. In the case of prodrugs whose actions are actually mediated by P450IID6- produced metabolites (for example, <span class="Bold">codeine </span>and <span class="Bold">hydrocodone, </span>whose analgesic and antitussive effects appear to be mediated by morphine and hydromorphone, respectively), it may not be possible to achieve the desired clinical benefits in poor metabolizers.</p>
<p>Quinidine is not metabolized by cytochrome P450IID6, but therapeutic serum levels of quinidine inhibit the action of cytochrome P450IID6, effectively converting extensive metabolizers into poor metabolizers. Caution must be exercised whenever quinidine is prescribed together with drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450IID6.</p>
<p>Perhaps by competing for pathways of renal clearance, coadministration of quinidine causes an increase in serum levels of <span class="Bold">procainamide.</span></p>
<p>Serum levels of <span class="Bold">haloperidol </span>are increased when quinidine is coadministered.</p>
<p>Presumably because both drugs are metabolized by cytochrome P450IIIA4, coadministration of quinidine causes variable slowing of the metabolism of <span class="Bold">nifedipine. </span>Interactions with other dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers have not been reported, but these agents (including <span class="Bold">felodipine, nicardipine, </span>and <span class="Bold">nimodipine</span>) are all dependent upon P450IIIA4 for metabolism, so similar interactions with quinidine should be anticipated.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section">
<a name="section-8.2.3"></a><p></p>
<h3>Altered Pharmacodynamics of Other Drugs</h3>
<p class="First">Quinidineâ€™s anticholinergic, vasodilating, and negative inotropic actions may be additive to those of other drugs with these effects, and antagonistic to those of drugs with cholinergic, vasoconstricting, and positive inotropic effects. For example, when quinidine and <span class="Bold">verapamil </span>are coadministered in doses that are each well tolerated as monotherapy, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span> attributable to additive peripheral Î±-blockade is sometimes reported.</p>
<p>Quinidine potentiates the actions of depolarizing (succinylcholine, decamethonium) and nondepolarizing ( <span class="Italics">d</span>-tubocurarine, pancuronium) <span class="Bold">neuromuscular blocking agents. </span>These phenomena are not well understood, but they are observed in animal models as well as in humans. In addition, <span class="Italics">in vitro </span>addition of quinidine to the serum of pregnant women reduces the activity of pseudocholinesterase, an enzyme that is essential to the metabolism of succinylcholine.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section">
<a name="section-8.2.4"></a><p></p>
<h3>Non-interactions of Quinidine With Other Drugs</h3>
<p class="First">Quinidine has no clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of <span class="Bold">diltiazem, flecainide, mephenytoin, metoprolol, propafenone, propranolol, quinine, timolol, </span>or <span class="Bold">tocainide.</span></p>
<p>Conversely, the pharmacokinetics of quinidine are not significantly affected by <span class="Bold">caffeine, ciprofloxacin, digoxin, felodipine, omeprazole, </span>or <span class="Bold">quinine. </span>Quinidineâ€™s pharmacokinetics are also unaffected by cigarette smoking.</p>

<h2>Information for Patients</h2>
<p class="First">Before prescribing quinidine gluconate as prophylaxis against recurrence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="313217" conceptname="Atrial fibrillation">atrial fibrillation</span>, the physician should inform the patient of the risks and benefits to be expected (see<span class="Bold"><a href="#AAC87F04-3328-422B-955D-DB6632355FE6">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</a></span>).

<h2>Pregnancy</h2>

<h2>Nursing Mothers</h2>
<p class="First">Quinidine is present in human milk at levels slightly lower than those in maternal serum; a human infant ingesting such milk should (scaling directly by weight) be expected to develop serum quinidine levels at least an order of magnitude lower than those of the mother. On the other hand, the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of quinidine in human infants have not been adequately studied, and neonatesâ€™ reduced protein binding of quinidine may increase their risk of toxicity at low total serum levels. Administration of quinidine should (if possible) be avoided in lactating women who continue to nurse.</p>

<h2><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="44784217" conceptname="Cardiac arrhythmia">Arrhythmias</span></h2>
<p class="First">Serum quinidine levels can be conveniently assayed and monitored, but the electrocardiographic QT<span class="Sub">c</span> interval is a better predictor of quinidine-induced <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4185572" conceptname="Ventricular arrhythmia">ventricular arrhythmias</span>.</p>
<p>The necessary treatment of hemodynamically unstable <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4103295" conceptname="Ventricular tachycardia">polymorphic ventricular tachycardia</span> (including <span class="Italics"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4135823" conceptname="Torsades de pointes">torsades de pointes</span></span>) is withdrawal of treatment with quinidine and either immediate cardioversion or, if a cardiac pacemaker is in place or immediately available, immediate overdrive pacing. After pacing or cardioversion, further management must be guided by the length of the QT<span class="Sub">c</span> interval.</p>
<p>Quinidine-associated <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4103295" conceptname="Ventricular tachycardia">ventricular tachyarrhythmias</span> with normal underlying QT<span class="Sub">c</span> intervals have not been adequately studied. Because of the theoretical possibility of QT-prolonging effects that might be additive to those of quinidine, other antiarrhythmics with Class I (disopyramide, procainamide) or Class III activities should (if possible) be avoided. Similarly, although the use of bretylium in quinidine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> has not been reported, it is reasonable to expect that the Î±-blocking properties of bretylium might be additive to those of quinidine, resulting in problematic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>.</p>
<p>If the post-cardioversion QT<span class="Sub">c</span> interval is prolonged, then the precardioversion <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4103295" conceptname="Ventricular tachycardia">polymorphic ventricular tachycardia</span> was (by definition) <span class="Italics"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4135823" conceptname="Torsades de pointes">torsades de pointes</span>. </span>In this case, lidocaine and bretylium are unlikely to be of value, and other Class I antiarrhythmics (disopyramide, procainamide) are likely to exacerbate the situation. Factors contributing to QT<span class="Sub">c</span> prolongation (especially <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437833" conceptname="Hypokalemia">hypokalemia</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4098604" conceptname="Hypomagnesemia">hypomagnesemia</span>) should be sought out and (if possible) aggressively corrected. Prevention of recurrent <span class="Italics">torsades </span>may require sustained overdrive pacing or the cautious administration of isoproterenol (30-150 ng/kg/min).</p>

<h2>Treatment</h2>
<p class="First">To obtain up-to-date information about the treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>, a good resource is your certified Regional Poison-Control Center. Telephone numbers of certified poison-control centers are listed in the Physiciansâ€™ Desk Reference (PDR). In managing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>, consider the possibilities of multiple-drug <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdoses</span>, drug-drug interactions, and unusual drug kinetics in your patient.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section">

<h2>Accelerated Removal</h2>
<p class="First">Adequate studies of orally-administered activated charcoal in human <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdoses</span> of quinidine have not been reported, but there are animal data showing significant enhancement of systemic elimination following this intervention, and there is at least one human case report in which the elimination half-life of quinidine in the serum was apparently shortened by repeated gastric lavage. Activated charcoal should be avoided if an <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="193518" conceptname="Intestinal obstruction">ileus</span> is present; the conventional dose is 1 gram/kg, administered every 2 to 6 hours as a slurry with 8 mL/kg of tap water.</p>
<p>Although renal elimination of quinidine might theoretically be accelerated by maneuvers to acidify the urine, such maneuvers are potentially hazardous and of no demonstrated benefit.</p>
<p>Quinidine is not usefully removed from the circulation by dialysis.</p>
<p>Following quinidine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span>, drugs that delay elimination of quinidine (cimetidine, carbonic-anhydrase inhibitors, diltiazem, thiazide diuretics) should be withdrawn unless absolutely required.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">The dose of quinidine delivered by quinidine gluconate extended-release tablets may be titrated by breaking a tablet in half. If tablets are crushed or chewed, their extended-release properties will be lost.</p>
<p>The dosage of quinidine varies considerably depending upon the general condition and the cardiovascular state of the patient.</p>

<h2>Conversion of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="313217" conceptname="Atrial fibrillation">Atrial Fibrillation</span>/Flutter to Sinus Rhythm</h2>
<p class="First">Especially in patients with known structural heart disease or other risk factors for toxicity, initiation or dose-adjustment of treatment with quinidine gluconate should generally be performed in a setting where facilities and personnel for monitoring and resuscitation are continuously available. Patients with symptomatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="313217" conceptname="Atrial fibrillation">atrial fibrillation</span>/flutter should be treated with quinidine gluconate only after ventricular rate control (e.g., with digitalis or ÃŸ-blockers) has failed to provide satisfactory control of symptoms.</p>
<p>Adequate trials have not identified an optimal regimen of quinidine gluconate for conversion of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="313217" conceptname="Atrial fibrillation">atrial fibrillation</span>/flutter to sinus rhythm. In one reported regimen, the patient first receives two tablets (648 mg; 403 mg of quinidine base) of quinidine gluconate every eight hours. If this regimen has not resulted in conversion after 3 or 4 doses, then the dose is cautiously increased. If, at any point during administration, the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4064625" conceptname="QRS complex feature">QRS complex</span> widens to 130% of its pre-treatment duration; the QT<span class="Sub">c</span> interval widens to 130% of its pre-treatment duration and is then longer than 500 ms; P waves disappear; or the patient develops significant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">tachycardia</span>, symptomatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169095" conceptname="Bradycardia">bradycardia</span>, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, then quinidine gluconate is discontinued, and other means of conversion (e.g., direct-current cardioversion) are considered.</p>
<p>In another regimen sometimes used, the patient receives one tablet (324 mg; 202 mg of quinidine base) every eight hours for two days; then two tablets every twelve hours for two days; and finally two tablets every eight hours for up to four days. The four-day stretch may come at one of the lower doses if, in the judgment of the physician, the lower dose is the highest one that will be tolerated. The criteria for discontinuation of treatment with quinidine gluconate are the same as in the other regimen.</p>

<h2>Reduction in the Frequency of Relapse into <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="313217" conceptname="Atrial fibrillation">Atrial Fibrillation</span>/Flutter</h2>
<p class="First">In a patient with a history of frequent symptomatic episodes of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="313217" conceptname="Atrial fibrillation">atrial fibrillation</span>/flutter, the goal of therapy with quinidine gluconate should be an increase in the average time between episodes. In most patients, the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">tachyarrhythmia</span> <span class="Italics">will recur </span>during therapy with quinidine gluconate, and a single recurrence should not be interpreted as therapeutic failure.</p>
<p>Especially in patients with known structural heart disease or other risk factors for toxicity, initiation or dose-adjustment of treatment with quinidine gluconate should generally be performed in a setting where facilities and personnel for monitoring and resuscitation are continuously available. Monitoring should be continued for two or three days after initiation of the regimen on which the patient will be discharged.</p>
<p>Therapy with quinidine gluconate should begin with one tablet (324 mg; 202 mg of quinidine base) every eight or twelve hours. If this regimen is well tolerated, if the serum quinidine level is still well within the laboratoryâ€™s therapeutic range, and if the average time between arrhythmic episodes has not been satisfactorily increased, then the dose may be cautiously raised. The total daily dosage should be reduced if the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4064625" conceptname="QRS complex feature">QRS complex</span> widens to 130% of its pre-treatment duration; the QT<span class="Sub">c</span> interval widens to 130% of its pre-treatment duration and is then longer than 500 ms; P waves disappear; or the patient develops significant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="315643" conceptname="Tachyarrhythmia">tachycardia</span>, symptomatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4169095" conceptname="Bradycardia">bradycardia</span>, or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>.</p>

<p class="First">Dosing regimens for the use of quinidine gluconate in suppressing life-threatening <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4185572" conceptname="Ventricular arrhythmia">ventricular arrhythmias</span> have not been adequately studied. Described regimens have generally been similar to the regimen described just above for the prophylaxis of symptomatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="313217" conceptname="Atrial fibrillation">atrial fibrillation</span>/flutter. Where possible, therapy should be guided by the results of programmed electrical stimulation and/or Holter monitoring with exercise.</p>
