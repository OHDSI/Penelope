<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">MIRAPEX tablets contain pramipexole, a nonergot dopamine agonist. The chemical name of pramipexole dihydrochloride is (<span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">S</span></span>)-2-amino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-6-(propylamino)benzothiazole dihydrochloride monohydrate. Its empirical formula is C<span class="Sub">10</span> H<span class="Sub">17</span> N<span class="Sub">3</span> S â€¢ 2HCl â€¢ H<span class="Sub">2</span>O, and its molecular weight is 302.27. </p>
<p>The structural formula is: <br><img alt="Mirapex Structure" src="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/image.cfm?setid=3736d691-e8b9-4fdd-aeca-9e96cf907c51&amp;name=b5504316-3907-444c-b604-ec9a18cdcd6d-01.jpg"></p>
<p>Pramipexole dihydrochloride is a white to off-white powder substance. Melting occurs in the range of 296Â°C to 301Â°C, with decomposition. Pramipexole dihydrochloride is more than 20% soluble in water, about 8% in methanol, about 0.5% in ethanol, and practically insoluble in dichloromethane. </p>
<p>MIRAPEX tablets, for oral administration, contain 0.125 mg, 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, 0.75 mg, 1 mg, or 1.5 mg of pramipexole dihydrochloride monohydrate. Inactive ingredients consist of mannitol, cornstarch, colloidal silicon dioxide, povidone, and magnesium stearate. </p>

<h2>Mechanism of Action</h2>
<p class="First">Pramipexole is a nonergot dopamine agonist with high relative in vitro specificity and full intrinsic activity at the D<span class="Sub">2</span> subfamily of dopamine receptors, binding with higher affinity to D<span class="Sub">3</span> than to D<span class="Sub">2</span> or D<span class="Sub">4</span> receptor subtypes. </p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Parkinsonâ€™s Disease:</span></span> The precise mechanism of action of pramipexole as a treatment for Parkinson's disease is unknown, although it is believed to be related to its ability to stimulate dopamine receptors in the striatum. This conclusion is supported by electrophysiologic studies in animals that have demonstrated that pramipexole influences striatal neuronal firing rates via activation of dopamine receptors in the striatum and the substantia nigra, the site of neurons that send projections to the striatum. The relevance of D<span class="Sub">3</span> receptor binding in Parkinsonâ€™s disease is unknown.</p>

Although the pathophysiology of RLS is largely unknown, neuropharmacological evidence suggests primary dopaminergic system involvement. Positron Emission Tomographic (PET) studies suggest that a mild striatal presynaptic dopaminergic dysfunction may be involved in the pathogenesis of RLS.</p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
<p class="First">Pramipexole displays linear pharmacokinetics over the clinical dosage range. Its terminal half-life is about 8 hours in young healthy volunteers and about 12 hours in elderly volunteers (see <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><a href="#i4i_section_id_264adb83-f1b0-4ce9-ae23-3672fcd3b3ae">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations</a></span></span>). Steady-state concentrations are achieved within 2 days of dosing.</p>

<p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">Absorption</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>Pramipexole is rapidly absorbed, reaching peak concentrations in approximately 2 hours. The absolute bioavailability of pramipexole is greater than 90%, indicating that it is well absorbed and undergoes little presystemic metabolism. Food does not affect the extent of pramipexole absorption, although the time of maximum plasma concentration (T<span class="Sub">max</span>) is increased by about 1 hour when the drug is taken with a meal.</p>

<p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">Distribution</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>Pramipexole is extensively distributed, having a volume of distribution of about 500 L (coefficient of variation [CV]=20%). It is about 15% bound to plasma proteins. Pramipexole distributes into red blood cells as indicated by an erythrocyte-to-plasma ratio of approximately 2.</p>
</div>

<p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">Metabolism and Elimination</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>The terminal half-life of pramipexole is about 8 hours in healthy volunteers and 12 hours in elderly volunteers.</p>
<p>Urinary excretion is the major route of pramipexole elimination, with 90% of a pramipexole dose recovered in urine, almost all as unchanged drug. Nonrenal routes may contribute to a small extent to pramipexole elimination, although no metabolites have been identified in plasma or urine. The renal clearance of pramipexole is approximately 400 mL/min (CV=25%), approximately three times higher than the glomerular filtration rate. Thus, pramipexole is secreted by the renal tubules, probably by the organic cation transport system.</p>

<h2>Pharmacodynamics</h2>
<p class="First">In a clinical trial with healthy volunteers, where pramipexole was titrated faster than recommended (every 3 days) up to 4.5 mg per day, an increase in blood pressure and heart rate was observed. Although mean values remained within normal reference ranges throughout the study, supine systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and pulse rate for subjects treated with pramipexole generally increased during the up-titration phase, up to 10 mmHg, 7 mmHg, and 10 bpm higher than placebo, respectively. Higher SBP, DBP, and pulse rates compared to placebo were maintained until the pramipexole doses were tapered; values on the last day of tapering were generally similar to baseline values. Such effects have not been observed in clinical studies with Parkinsonâ€™s disease patients, and are most likely due to the forced up-titration every 3 days.</p>

<h2>Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations</h2>
<p class="First">Because therapy with MIRAPEX tablets is initiated at a low dose and gradually titrated upward according to clinical tolerability to obtain the optimum therapeutic effect, adjustment of the initial dose based on gender, weight, or age is not necessary. However, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">renal insufficiency</span>, which can cause a large decrease in the ability to eliminate pramipexole, may necessitate dosage adjustment (see <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"> CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, </span></span><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis"><a href="#i4i_section_id_264adb83-f1b0-4ce9-ae23-3672fcd3b3ae"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">Renal Insufficiency</span></a></span></span></span></span></span>).</p>

<p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">Gender</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>Pramipexole clearance is about 30% lower in women than in men, but most of this difference can be accounted for by differences in body weight. There is no difference in half-life between males and females.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">

<p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">Age</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>Pramipexole clearance decreases with age as the half-life and clearance are about 40% longer and 30% lower, respectively, in elderly (aged 65 years or older) compared with young healthy volunteers (aged less than 40 years). This difference is most likely due to the well-known reduction in renal function with age, since pramipexole clearance is correlated with renal function, as measured by creatinine clearance (see <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"> CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, </span></span><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis"><a href="#i4i_section_id_264adb83-f1b0-4ce9-ae23-3672fcd3b3ae"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">Renal Insufficiency</span></a></span></span></span></span></span>).</p>

<p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">Parkinson's Disease Patients</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>A cross-study comparison of data suggests that the clearance of pramipexole may be reduced by about 30% in Parkinson's disease patients compared with healthy elderly volunteers. The reason for this difference appears to be reduced renal function in Parkinson's disease patients, which may be related to their poorer general health. The pharmacokinetics of pramipexole were comparable between early and advanced Parkinson's disease patients.</p>

In patients with varying degrees of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span>, pramipexole clearance correlates well with creatinine clearance. Therefore, creatinine clearance can be used as a predictor of the extent of decrease in pramipexole clearance.

<h2>Parkinson's Disease</h2>
<p class="First">The effectiveness of MirapexÂ® (pramipexole dihydrochloride) tablets in the treatment of Parkinson's disease was evaluated in a multinational drug development program consisting of seven randomized, controlled trials. Three were conducted in patients with early Parkinson's disease who were not receiving concomitant levodopa, and four were conducted in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease who were receiving concomitant levodopa. Among these seven studies, three studies provide the most persuasive evidence of pramipexole's effectiveness in the management of patients with Parkinson's disease who were and were not receiving concomitant levodopa. Two of these three trials enrolled patients with early Parkinson's disease (not receiving levodopa), and one enrolled patients with advanced Parkinson's disease who were receiving maximally tolerated doses of levodopa. </p>
<p>In all studies, the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), or one or more of its subparts, served as the primary outcome assessment measure. The UPDRS is a four-part multi-item rating scale intended to evaluate mentation (part I), Activities of Daily Living (ADL) (part II), motor performance (part III), and complications of therapy (part IV). </p>
<p>Part II of the UPDRS contains 13 questions relating to ADL, which are scored from 0 (normal) to 4 (maximal severity) for a maximum (worst) score of 52. Part III of the UPDRS contains 27 questions (for 14 items) and is scored as described for part II. It is designed to assess the severity of the cardinal motor findings in patients with Parkinson's disease (e.g., <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443782" conceptname="Tremor">tremor</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4050941" conceptname="Muscle rigidity">rigidity</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4161417" conceptname="Bradykinesia">bradykinesia</span>, postural instability, etc.), scored for different body regions, and has a maximum (worst) score of 108. </p>

<p>Patients (N=599) in the two studies of early Parkinson's disease had a mean disease duration of 2 years, limited or no prior exposure to levodopa (generally none in the preceding 6 months), and were not experiencing the "on-off" phenomenon and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4047115" conceptname="Oral dyskinesia">dyskinesia</span> characteristic of later stages of the disease. </p>
<p>One of the two early Parkinson's disease studies (N=335) was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel trial consisting of a 7-week dose-escalation period and a 6-month maintenance period. Patients could be on selegiline, anticholinergics, or both, but could not be on levodopa products or amantadine. Patients were randomized to MirapexÂ® (pramipexole dihydrochloride) tablets or placebo. Patients treated with MIRAPEX tablets had a starting daily dose of 0.375 mg and were titrated to a maximally tolerated dose, but no higher than 4.5 mg/day in three divided doses. At the end of the 6-month maintenance period, the mean improvement from baseline on the UPDRS part II (ADL) total score was 1.9 in the group receiving MIRAPEX tablets and -0.4 in the placebo group, a difference that was statistically significant. The mean improvement from baseline on the UPDRS part III total score was 5.0 in the group receiving MIRAPEX tablets and -0.8 in the placebo group, a difference that was also statistically significant. A statistically significant difference between groups in favor of MIRAPEX tablets was seen beginning at week 2 of the UPDRS part II (maximum dose 0.75 mg/day) and at week 3 of the UPDRS part III (maximum dose 1.5 mg/day).</p>
<p>The second early Parkinson's disease study (N=264) was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel trial consisting of a 6-week dose-escalation period and a 4-week maintenance period. Patients could be on selegiline, anticholinergics, amantadine, or any combination of these, but could not be on levodopa products. Patients were randomized to 1 of 4 fixed doses of MIRAPEX tablets (1.5 mg, 3.0 mg, 4.5 mg, or 6.0 mg per day) or placebo. At the end of the 4-week maintenance period, the mean improvement from baseline on the UPDRS part II total score was 1.8 in the patients treated with MIRAPEX tablets, regardless of assigned dose group, and 0.3 in placebo-treated patients. The mean improvement from baseline on the UPDRS part III total score was 4.2 in patients treated with MIRAPEX tablets and 0.6 in placebo-treated patients. No dose-response relationship was demonstrated. The between-treatment differences on both parts of the UPDRS were statistically significant in favor of MIRAPEX tablets for all doses. </p>
<p>No differences in effectiveness based on age or gender were detected. There were too few non-Caucasian patients to evaluate the effect of race. Patients receiving selegiline or anticholinergics had responses similar to patients not receiving these drugs.</p>

<p>In the advanced Parkinson's disease study, the primary assessments were the UPDRS and daily diaries that quantified amounts of "on" and "off" time. </p>
<p>Patients in the advanced Parkinson's disease study (N=360) had a mean disease duration of 9 years, had been exposed to levodopa for long periods of time (mean 8 years), used concomitant levodopa during the trial, and had "on-off" periods.</p>
<p>The advanced Parkinson's disease study was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel trial consisting of a 7-week dose-escalation period and a 6-month maintenance period. Patients were all treated with concomitant levodopa products and could additionally be on concomitant selegiline, anticholinergics, amantadine, or any combination. Patients treated with MIRAPEX tablets had a starting dose of 0.375 mg/day and were titrated to a maximally tolerated dose, but no higher than 4.5 mg/day in three divided doses. At selected times during the 6-month maintenance period, patients were asked to record the amount of "off," "on," or "on with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4047115" conceptname="Oral dyskinesia">dyskinesia</span>" time per day for several sequential days. At the end of the 6-month maintenance period, the mean improvement from baseline on the UPDRS part II total score was 2.7 in the group treated with MirapexÂ® (pramipexole dihydrochloride) tablets and 0.5 in the placebo group, a difference that was statistically significant. The mean improvement from baseline on the UPDRS part III total score was 5.6 in the group treated with MIRAPEX tablets and 2.8 in the placebo group, a difference that was statistically significant. A statistically significant difference between groups in favor of MIRAPEX tablets was seen at week 3 of the UPDRS part II (maximum dose 1.5 mg/day) and at week 2 of the UPDRS part III (maximum dose 0.75 mg/day). Dosage reduction of levodopa was allowed during this study if <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4047115" conceptname="Oral dyskinesia">dyskinesia</span> (or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433031" conceptname="Hallucinations">hallucinations</span>) developed; levodopa dosage reduction occurred in 76% of patients treated with MIRAPEX tablets versus 54% of placebo patients. On average, the levodopa dose was reduced 27%. </p>
<p>The mean number of "off" hours per day during baseline was 6 hours for both treatment groups. Throughout the trial, patients treated with MIRAPEX tablets had a mean of 4 "off" hours per day, while placebo-treated patients continued to experience 6 "off" hours per day. </p>
<p>No differences in effectiveness based on age or gender were detected. There were too few non-Caucasian patients to evaluate the effect of race.</p>

All patients were administered MIRAPEX tablets (0.125 mg, 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, or 0.75 mg) or placebo once daily 2-3 hours before going to bed. Across the 4 studies, the mean duration of RLS was 4.6 years (range of 0 to 56 years), mean age was approximately 55 years (range of 18 to 81 years), and approximately 66.6% were women.</p>
<p>The two outcome measures used to assess the effect of treatment were the International RLS Rating Scale (IRLS Scale) and a Clinical Global Impression - Improvement (CGI-I) assessment. The IRLS Scale contains 10 items designed to assess the severity of sensory and motor symptoms, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435524" conceptname="Sleep disorder">sleep disturbance</span>, daytime <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span>, and impact on activities of daily living and mood associated with RLS. The range of scores is 0 to 40, with 0 being absence of RLS symptoms and 40 the most severe symptoms. The CGI-I is designed to assess clinical progress (global improvement) on a 7-point scale. </p>
<p>In Study 1, fixed doses of MIRAPEX tablets were compared to placebo in a study of 12 weeks duration. A total of 344 patients were randomized equally to the 4 treatment groups. Patients treated with MIRAPEX tablets (n=254) had a starting dose of 0.125 mg/day and were titrated to one of the three randomized doses (0.25, 0.5, 0.75 mg/day) in the first three weeks of the study. The mean improvement from baseline on the IRLS Scale total score and the percentage of CGI-I responders for each of the MIRAPEX tablets treatment groups compared to placebo are summarized in Table 1. All treatment groups reached statistically significant superiority compared to placebo for both endpoints. There was no clear evidence of a dose-response across the 3 randomized dose groups.</p>

<p>Study 2 was a randomized-withdrawal study, designed to demonstrate the sustained efficacy of pramipexole for treatment of RLS after a period of six months. RLS patients who responded to MirapexÂ® (pramipexole dihydrochloride) tablets treatment in a preceding 6-month open label treatment phase (defined as having a CGI-I rating of â€œvery much improvedâ€? or â€œmuch improvedâ€? compared to baseline and an IRLS score of 15 or below) were randomized to receive either continued active treatment (n=78) or placebo (n=69) for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint of this study was time to treatment failure, defined as any worsening on the CGI-I score along with an IRLS Scale total score above 15. </p>
<p>In patients who had responded to 6-month open label treatment with MIRAPEX tablets, the administration of placebo led to a rapid decline in their overall conditions and return of their RLS symptoms. At the end of the 12-week observation period, 85% of patients treated with placebo had failed treatment, compared to 21% treated with blinded pramipexole, a difference that was highly statistically significant. The majority of treatment failures occurred within 10 days of randomization. For the patients randomized, the distribution of doses was: 7 on 0.125 mg, 44 on 0.25 mg, 47 on 0.5 mg, and 49 on 0.75 mg.</p>
<p>Study 3 was a 6-week study, comparing a flexible dose of MIRAPEX tablets to placebo. In this study, 345 patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to MIRAPEX tablets or placebo. The mean improvement from baseline on the IRLS Scale total score was -12 for Mirapex-treated patients and -6 for placebo-treated patients. The percentage of CGI-I responders was 63% for Mirapex-treated patients and 32% for placebo-treated patients. The between-group differences were statistically significant for both outcome measures. For the patients randomized to MIRAPEX tablets, the distribution of achieved doses was: 35 on 0.125 mg, 51 on 0.25 mg, 65 on 0.5 mg, and 69 on 0.75 mg.</p>
<p>Study 4 was a 3-week study, comparing 4 fixed doses of MIRAPEX tablets, 0.125 mg, 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, and 0.75 mg, to placebo. Approximately 20 patients were randomized to each of the 5 dose groups. The mean improvement from baseline on the IRLS Scale total score and the percentage of CGI-I responders for each of the MIRAPEX tablets treatment groups compared to placebo are summarized in Table 2. In this study, the 0.125 mg dose group was not significantly different from placebo. On average, the 0.5 mg dose group performed better than the 0.25 mg dose group, but there was no difference between the 0.5 mg and 0.75 mg dose groups. </p>

<h2><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">Falling</span> Asleep During Activities of Daily Living</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Patients treated with MirapexÂ® (pramipexole dihydrochloride) tablets have reported <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">falling</span> asleep while engaged in activities of daily living, including the operation of motor vehicles which sometimes resulted in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440279" conceptname="Accident">accidents</span>. Although many of these patients reported <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span> while on MIRAPEX tablets, some perceived that they had no warning signs such as excessive <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span>, and believed that they were alert immediately prior to the event. Some of these events had been reported as late as one year after the initiation of treatment. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">Somnolence</span> is a common occurrence in patients receiving MIRAPEX tablets at doses above 1.5 mg/day (0.5 mg TID) for Parkinsonâ€™s disease. In controlled clinical trials in RLS, patients treated with MIRAPEX tablets at doses of 0.25-0.75 mg once a day, the incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span> was 6% compared to an incidence of 3% for placebo-treated patients (see <a href="#id_e8eb0d61-2c8c-4f3d-a2c0-5c35f5a4cdf9">ADVERSE EVENTS, Table 5</a>). Many clinical experts believe that <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">falling</span> asleep while engaged in activities of daily living always occurs in a setting of pre-existing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span>, although patients may not give such a history. For this reason, prescribers should continually reassess patients for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">sleepiness</span>, especially since some of the events occur well after the start of treatment. Prescribers should also be aware that patients may not acknowledge <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">sleepiness</span> until directly questioned about <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">sleepiness</span> during specific activities.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Before initiating treatment with MIRAPEX tablets, patients should be advised of the potential to develop <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">drowsiness</span> and specifically asked about factors that may increase the risk with MIRAPEX tablets such as concomitant sedating medications, the presence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="435524" conceptname="Sleep disorder">sleep disorders</span>, and concomitant medications that increase pramipexole plasma levels (e.g., cimetidine - see <a href="#i4i_interactions_id_ab7d19ee-8f5a-4482-95f8-c67f3b7f2889">PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions</a>).

<h2>Symptomatic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">Hypotension</span></h2>
<p class="First">Dopamine agonists, in clinical studies and clinical experience, appear to impair the systemic regulation of blood pressure, with resulting <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319041" conceptname="Orthostatic hypotension">orthostatic hypotension</span>, especially during dose escalation. Parkinson's disease patients, in addition, appear to have an impaired capacity to respond to an orthostatic challenge. For these reasons, both Parkinson's disease patients and RLS patients being treated with dopaminergic agonists ordinarily require careful monitoring for signs and symptoms of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319041" conceptname="Orthostatic hypotension">orthostatic hypotension</span>, especially during dose escalation, and should be informed of this risk (see <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><a href="#i4i_section_id_12280a86-9779-4b7f-a0f0-6d852785fba1">PRECAUTIONS, Information for Patients</a></span></span>).</p>
<p>In clinical trials of pramipexole, however, and despite clear orthostatic effects in normal volunteers, the reported incidence of clinically significant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319041" conceptname="Orthostatic hypotension">orthostatic hypotension</span> was not greater among those assigned to MirapexÂ® (pramipexole dihydrochloride) tablets than among those assigned to placebo. This result, especially with the higher doses used in Parkinsonâ€™s disease, is clearly unexpected in light of the previous experience with the risks of dopamine agonist therapy.</p>
<p>While this finding could reflect a unique property of pramipexole, it might also be explained by the conditions of the study and the nature of the population enrolled in the clinical trials. Patients were very carefully titrated, and patients with active cardiovascular disease or significant <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319041" conceptname="Orthostatic hypotension">orthostatic hypotension</span> at baseline were excluded. Also, clinical trials in patients with RLS did not incorporate orthostatic challenges with intensive blood pressure monitoring done in close temporal proximity to dosing.</p>

<p>Age appears to increase the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433031" conceptname="Hallucinations">hallucinations</span> attributable to pramipexole. In the early Parkinson's disease patients, the risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433031" conceptname="Hallucinations">hallucinations</span> was 1.9 times greater than placebo in patients younger than 65 years and 6.8 times greater than placebo in patients older than 65 years.

<h2>Events Reported with Dopaminergic Therapy</h2>
<p class="First">Although the events enumerated below may not have been reported in association with the use of pramipexole in its development program, they are associated with the use of other dopaminergic drugs. The expected incidence of these events, however, is so low that even if pramipexole caused these events at rates similar to those attributable to other dopaminergic therapies, it would be unlikely that even a single case would have occurred in a cohort of the size exposed to pramipexole in studies to date.</p>

<p>Reports in the literature indicate treatment of RLS with dopaminergic medications can result in a shifting of symptoms to the early morning hours, referred to as rebound. Rebound was not reported in the clinical trials of MIRAPEX tablets but the trials were generally not of sufficient duration to capture this phenomenon. Augmentation has also been described during therapy for RLS. Augmentation refers to the earlier onset of symptoms in the evening (or even the afternoon), increase in symptoms, and spread of symptoms to involve other extremities. In a controlled trial of MIRAPEX tablets for RLS, approximately 20% of both the Mirapex- and the placebo-treated patients reported at least a 2-hour earlier onset of symptoms during the day by the end of 3 months of treatment. The frequency and severity of augmentation and/or rebound after longer-term use of MIRAPEX tablets and the appropriate management of these events have not been adequately evaluated in controlled clinical trials.</p>

<h2>Information for Patients (also see Patient Package Insert)</h2>
<p class="First">Patients should be instructed to take MIRAPEX tablets only as prescribed. </p>
<p>Patients should be alerted to the potential sedating effects associated with MIRAPEX tablets, including <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span> and the possibility of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">falling</span> asleep while engaged in activities of daily living. Since <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span> is a frequent adverse event with potentially serious consequences, patients should neither drive a car nor engage in other potentially dangerous activities until they have gained sufficient experience with MirapexÂ® (pramipexole dihydrochloride) tablets to gauge whether or not it affects their mental and/or motor performance adversely. Patients should be advised that if increased <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span> or new episodes of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">falling</span> asleep during activities of daily living (e.g., watching television, passenger in a car, etc.) are experienced at any time during treatment, they should not drive or participate in potentially dangerous activities until they have contacted their physician. Because of possible additive effects, caution should be advised when patients are taking other sedating medications or alcohol in combination with MIRAPEX tablets and when taking concomitant medications that increase plasma levels of pramipexole (e.g., cimetidine). </p>
<p>Patients should be informed that <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433031" conceptname="Hallucinations">hallucinations</span> can occur and that the elderly are at a higher risk than younger patients with Parkinson's disease. In clinical trials, patients with RLS treated with pramipexole rarely reported <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="433031" conceptname="Hallucinations">hallucinations</span>.</p>
<p>There have been reports of patients experiencing intense urges to gamble, increased sexual urges and other intense urges and the inability to control these urges while taking one or more of the medications that increase central dopaminergic tone, that are generally used for the treatment of Parkinsonâ€™s disease, including MIRAPEX tablets. Although it is not proven that the medications caused these events, these urges were reported to have stopped in some cases when the dose was reduced or the medication was stopped. Prescribers should ask patients about the development of new or increased <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4023166" conceptname="Gambling">gambling</span> urges, sexual urges, or other urges while being treated with MIRAPEX tablets. Patients should inform their physician if they experience new or increased <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4023166" conceptname="Gambling">gambling</span> urges, increased sexual urges or other intense urges while taking MIRAPEX tablets. Physicians should consider dose reduction or stopping the medication if a patient develops such urges while taking MIRAPEX tablets.</p>
<p>Patients may develop postural (orthostatic) <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">hypotension</span>, with or without symptoms such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4223938" conceptname="Dizziness">dizziness</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="135360" conceptname="Syncope">fainting</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="372448" conceptname="Loss of consciousness">blackouts</span>, and sometimes, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="138565" conceptname="Hyperhidrosis">sweating</span>. <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="316447" conceptname="Chronic hypotension">Hypotension</span> may occur more frequently during initial therapy. Accordingly, patients should be cautioned against rising rapidly after sitting or lying down, especially if they have been doing so for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4088438" conceptname="Prolonged periods">prolonged periods</span> and especially at the initiation of treatment with MIRAPEX tablets. </p>
<p>Because the teratogenic potential of pramipexole has not been completely established in laboratory animals, and because experience in humans is limited, patients should be advised to notify their physicians if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy (see <span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis"><a href="#i4i_pregnancy_id_95ae1de3-30ef-417a-897a-0b4bd7d6f6c0">PRECAUTIONS, Pregnancy</a></span></span>).</p>
<p>Because of the possibility that pramipexole may be excreted in breast milk, patients should be advised to notify their physicians if they intend to breast-feed or are breast-feeding an infant. </p>
<p>If patients develop <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, they should be advised that taking MIRAPEX tablets with food may reduce the occurrence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>.</p>

<h2>Drug Interactions</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">Carbidopa/levodopa:</span></span> Carbidopa/levodopa did not influence the pharmacokinetics of pramipexole in healthy volunteers (N=10). Pramipexole did not alter the extent of absorption (AUC) or the elimination of carbidopa/levodopa, although it caused an increase in levodopa C<span class="Sub">max</span> by about 40% and a decrease in T<span class="Sub">max</span> from 2.5 to 0.5 hours. </p>
<p><span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">Selegiline:</span></span> In healthy volunteers (N=11), selegiline did not influence the pharmacokinetics of pramipexole. </p>
<p><span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">Amantadine:</span></span> Population pharmacokinetic analyses suggest that amantadine may slightly decrease the oral clearance of pramipexole.</p>
<p><span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">Cimetidine:</span></span> Cimetidine, a known inhibitor of renal tubular secretion of organic bases via the cationic transport system, caused a 50% increase in pramipexole AUC and a 40% increase in half-life (N=12). </p>
<p><span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">Probenecid:</span></span> Probenecid, a known inhibitor of renal tubular secretion of organic acids via the anionic transporter, did not noticeably influence pramipexole pharmacokinetics (N=12). </p>
<p><span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">Other drugs eliminated via renal secretion:</span></span> Population pharmacokinetic analysis suggests that coadministration of drugs that are secreted by the cationic transport system (e.g., cimetidine, ranitidine, diltiazem, triamterene, verapamil, quinidine, and quinine) decreases the oral clearance of pramipexole by about 20%, while those secreted by the anionic transport system (e.g., cephalosporins, penicillins, indomethacin, hydrochlorothiazide, and chlorpropamide) are likely to have little effect on the oral clearance of pramipexole. </p>
<p><span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">CYP interactions:</span></span> Inhibitors of cytochrome P450 enzymes would not be expected to affect pramipexole elimination because pramipexole is not appreciably metabolized by these enzymes in vivo or in vitro. Pramipexole does not inhibit CYP enzymes CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Inhibition of CYP2D6 was observed with an apparent Ki of 30 ÂµM, indicating that pramipexole will not inhibit CYP enzymes at plasma concentrations observed following the clinical dose of 4.5 mg/day (1.5 mg TID). </p>
<p><span class="Italics"><span class="Emphasis">Dopamine antagonists:</span></span> Since pramipexole is a dopamine agonist, it is possible that dopamine antagonists, such as the neuroleptics (phenothiazines, butyrophenones, thioxanthenes) or metoclopramide, may diminish the effectiveness of MirapexÂ® (pramipexole dihydrochloride) tablets.</p>

<h2>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h2>
<p class="First">Two-year carcinogenicity studies with pramipexole have been conducted in mice and rats. Pramipexole was administered in the diet to Chbb:NMRI mice at doses of 0.3, 2, and 10 mg/kg/day [0.3, 2.2, and 11 times the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) (MRHD of 1.5 mg TID on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis)]. Pramipexole was administered in the diet to Wistar rats at 0.3, 2, and 8 mg/kg/day (plasma AUCs were 0.3, 2.5, and 12.5 times the AUC in humans at the MRHD). No significant increases in tumors occurred in either species.</p>
<p>Pramipexole was not mutagenic or clastogenic in a battery of assays, including the in vitro Ames assay, V79 gene mutation assay for HGPRT mutants, chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster ovary cells, and in vivo mouse micronucleus assay. </p>
<p>In rat fertility studies, pramipexole at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg/day (5 times the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis), prolonged estrus cycles and inhibited implantation. These effects were associated with reductions in serum levels of prolactin, a hormone necessary for implantation and maintenance of early pregnancy in rats.</p>

<p>When pramipexole was given to female rats throughout pregnancy, implantation was inhibited at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg/day (5 times the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis). Administration of 1.5 mg/kg/day of pramipexole to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis (gestation days 7 through 16) resulted in a high incidence of total resorption of embryos. The plasma AUC in rats at this dose was 4 times the AUC in humans at the MRHD. These findings are thought to be due to the prolactin-lowering effect of pramipexole, since prolactin is necessary for implantation and maintenance of early pregnancy in rats (but not rabbits or humans). Because of pregnancy disruption and early embryonic loss in these studies, the teratogenic potential of pramipexole could not be adequately evaluated. There was no evidence of adverse effects on embryo-fetal development following administration of up to 10 mg/kg/day to pregnant rabbits during organogenesis (plasma AUC was 71 times that in humans at the MRHD). Postnatal growth was inhibited in the offspring of rats treated with 0.5 mg/kg/day (approximately equivalent to the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) or greater during the latter part of pregnancy and throughout lactation. </p>
<p>There are no studies of pramipexole in human pregnancy. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, pramipexole should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the fetus. </p>

<p>It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from pramipexole, a decision should be made as to whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.</p>

<h2>Geriatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">Pramipexole total oral clearance was approximately 30% lower in subjects older than 65 years compared with younger subjects, because of a decline in pramipexole renal clearance due to an age-related reduction in renal function. This resulted in an increase in elimination half-life from approximately 8.5 hours to 12 hours. In clinical studies with Parkinsonâ€™s disease patients, 38.7% of patients were older than 65 years.

<h2>Parkinson's Disease</h2>
<p class="First">During the premarketing development of pramipexole, patients with either early or advanced Parkinson's disease were enrolled in clinical trials. Apart from the severity and duration of their disease, the two populations differed in their use of concomitant levodopa therapy. Patients with early disease did not receive concomitant levodopa therapy during treatment with pramipexole; those with advanced Parkinson's disease all received concomitant levodopa treatment. Because these two populations may have differential risks for various adverse events, this section will, in general, present adverse-event data for these two populations separately.</p>
<p>Because the controlled trials performed during premarketing development all used a titration design, with a resultant confounding of time and dose, it was impossible to adequately evaluate the effects of dose on the incidence of adverse events.</p>

<h4>Adverse-event Incidence in Controlled Clinical Studies in Early Parkinson's Disease</h4>
<p class="First">Table 3 lists treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in the double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in early Parkinson's disease that were reported by â‰¥1% of patients treated with MIRAPEX tablets and were numerically more frequent than in the placebo group. In these studies, patients did not receive concomitant levodopa. Adverse events were usually mild or moderate in intensity. </p>
<p>The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the incidence of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical studies. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, and investigators. However, the cited figures do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse-event incidence rate in the population studied.</p>

<p class="First">MIRAPEX tablets for treatment of RLS have been evaluated for safety in 889 patients, including 427 treated for over six months and 75 for over one year. </p>
<p>The overall safety assessment focuses on the results of three double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, in which 575 patients with RLS were treated with MIRAPEX tablets for up to 12 weeks. The most commonly observed adverse events with MIRAPEX tablets in the treatment of RLS (observed in &gt; 5% of pramipexole-treated patients and at a rate at least twice that observed in placebo-treated patients) were <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span>. Occurrences of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span> in clinical trials were generally mild and transient.</p>
<p>Approximately 7% of 575 patients treated with MIRAPEX tablets during the double-blind periods of three placebo-controlled trials discontinued treatment due to adverse events compared to 5% of 223 patients who received placebo. The adverse event most commonly causing discontinuation of treatment was <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span> (1%).</p>
<p>Table 5 lists treatment-emergent events that occurred in three double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in RLS patients that were reported by â‰¥ 2% of patients treated with MIRAPEX tablets and were numerically more frequent than in the placebo group. </p>
<p>The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the incidence of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical studies. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, and investigators. However, the cited figures do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse-event incidence rate in the population studied.</p>

<p>MIRAPEX tablets have been administered to 1620 Parkinsonâ€™s disease patients and to 889 RLS patients in Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials. During these trials, all adverse events were recorded by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing; similar types of events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using MedDRA dictionary terminology. These categories are used in the listing below. Adverse events which are not listed above but occurred on at least two occasions (one occasion if the event was serious) in the 2509 individuals exposed to MIRAPEX tablets are listed below. The reported events below are included without regard to determination of a causal relationship to MIRAPEX tablets.</p>

<p>In addition to the adverse events reported during clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of MIRAPEX tablets, primarily in Parkinsonâ€™s disease patients. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to pramipexole tablets.

Blood pressure remained stable although <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="444070" conceptname="Tachycardia">pulse rate increased</span> to between 100 and 120 beats/minute. The patient withdrew from the study at the end of week 2 due to lack of efficacy.</p>
<p>There is no known antidote for overdosage of a dopamine agonist. If signs of central nervous system stimulation are present, a phenothiazine or other butyrophenone neuroleptic agent may be indicated; the efficacy of such drugs in reversing the effects of overdosage has not been assessed. Management of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> may require general supportive measures along with gastric lavage, intravenous fluids, and electrocardiogram monitoring.</p>

<p>MirapexÂ® (pramipexole dihydrochloride) tablets were effective and well tolerated over a dosage range of 1.5 to 4.5 mg/day administered in equally divided doses three times per day with or without concomitant levodopa (approximately 800 mg/day).</p>
<p>In a fixed-dose study in early Parkinson's disease patients, doses of 3 mg, 4.5 mg, and 6 mg per day of MIRAPEX tablets were not shown to provide any significant benefit beyond that achieved at a daily dose of 1.5 mg/day. However, in the same fixed-dose study, the following adverse events were dose related: <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="319041" conceptname="Orthostatic hypotension">postural hypotension</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="31967" conceptname="Nausea">nausea</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="75860" conceptname="Constipation">constipation</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196193" conceptname="Drowsiness">somnolence</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439147" conceptname="Amnesia">amnesia</span>.

<h2>Retinal Pathology in Albino Rats</h2>
<p class="First">Pathologic changes (degeneration and loss of photoreceptor cells) were observed in the retina of albino rats in the 2-year carcinogenicity study with pramipexole. These findings were first observed during week 76 and were dose dependent in animals receiving 2 or 8 mg/kg/day (plasma AUCs equal to 2.5 and 12.5 times the AUC in humans that received 1.5 mg TID). In a similar study of pigmented rats with 2 years exposure to pramipexole at 2 or 8 mg/kg/day, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4090255" conceptname="Retinal drusen">retinal degeneration</span> was not diagnosed. Animals given drug had thinning in the outer nuclear layer of the retina that was only slightly greater than that seen in control rats utilizing morphometry.</p>
<p>Investigative studies demonstrated that pramipexole reduced the rate of disk shedding from the photoreceptor rod cells of the retina in albino rats, which was associated with enhanced sensitivity to the damaging effects of light. In a comparative study, degeneration and loss of photoreceptor cells occurred in albino rats after 13 weeks of treatment with 25 mg/kg/day of pramipexole (54 times the highest clinical dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) and constant light (100 lux) but not in pigmented rats exposed to the same dose and higher light intensities (500 lux). Thus, the retina of albino rats is considered to be uniquely sensitive to the damaging effects of pramipexole and light. Similar changes in the retina did not occur in a 2-year carcinogenicity study in albino mice treated with 0.3, 2, or 10 mg/kg/day (0.3, 2.2 and 11 times the highest clinical dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis). Evaluation of the retinas of monkeys given 0.1, 0.5, or 2.0 mg/kg/day of pramipexole (0.4, 2.2, and 8.6 times the highest clinical dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) for 12 months and minipigs given 0.3, 1, or 5 mg/kg/day of pramipexole for 13 weeks also detected no changes. </p>
<p>The potential significance of this effect in humans has not been established, but cannot be disregarded because disruption of a mechanism that is universally present in vertebrates (i.e., disk shedding) may be involved.</p>

<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Other Information about MIRAPEX</span></span><br>Studies of people with Parkinsonâ€™s disease show that they may be at an increased risk of developing melanoma, a form of skin cancer, when compared to people without Parkinsonâ€™s disease. It is not known if this problem is associated with Parkinsonâ€™s disease or the medicines used to treat Parkinsonâ€™s disease. MIRAPEX is one of the medicines used to treat Parkinsonâ€™s disease, therefore, patients being treated with MIRAPEX should have periodic skin examinations.</p>
<p>There have been reports of patients taking certain medicines to treat Parkinsonâ€™s disease or RLS, including MIRAPEX, that have reported problems with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4023166" conceptname="Gambling">gambling</span>, compulsive eating, compulsive shopping, and increased sex drive. It is not possible to reliably estimate how often these behaviors occur or to determine which factors may contribute to them. If you or your family members notice that you are developing unusual behaviors, talk to your doctor. </p>
<p><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">How should I store MIRAPEX?</span></span></p>

<li>Keep MIRAPEX out of light.</li>
