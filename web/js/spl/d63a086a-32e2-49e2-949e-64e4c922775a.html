<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<a href="#section-"></a><p class="First">Pharmacodynamics</p>
<p>Amphetamines are non-catecholamine sympathomimetic amines with CNS stimulant activity.Â  The mode of therapeutic action in Attention Deficit <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4137162" conceptname="Overactive">Hyperactivity</span> Disorder (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4228617" conceptname="Add">ADHD</span>) is not known.Â  Amphetamines are thought to block the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine into the presynaptic neuron and increase the release of these monoamines into the extraneuronal space.</p>
<p>Pharmacokinetics</p>
<p>Tablets of Mixed Salts of a Single Entity Amphetamine Product contain d-amphetamine and I-amphetamine salts in the ration of 3:1.Â  Following administration of a single dose 10 or 30 mg of Tablets of Mixed Salts of a Single Entity Amphetamine Product to healthy volunteers under fasted conditions, peak plasma concentrations occurred approximately 3 hours post-dose for both d-amphetamine and I-amphetamine.Â  The mean elimination half-life (t<span class="Sub">Â½</span>) for d-amphetamine was shorter than the t<span class="Sub">Â½</span> of the l-isomer (9.77 to 11 hours vs. 11.5 to 13.8 hours). 
The PK parameters (C<span class="Sub">max</span>, AUC<span class="Sub">0-inf</span>) of d-and l-amphetamine increased approximately three-fold from 10 mg to 30 mg indicating dose-proportional pharmacokinetics.</p>
<p>The effect of food on the bioavailability of Tablets of Mixed Salts of a Single Entity Amphetamine Product has not been studied.</p>
<p>Metabolism and Excretion</p>
<p>Amphetamine is reported to be oxidized at the 4 position of the benzene ring to form
4-hydroxyamphetamine, or on the side chain Î± or Î² carbons to form
alpha-hydroxy-amphetamine or norephedrine, respectively. Norephedrine
and 4-hydroxy-amphetamine are both active and each is subsequently
oxidized to form 4-hydroxy-norephedrine. Alpha-hydroxy-amphetamine
undergoes deamination to form phenylacetone, which ultimately forms
benzoic acid and its glucuronide and the glycine conjugate hippuric
acid. Although the enzymes involved in amphetamine metabolism have not
been clearly defined, CYP2D6 is known to be involved with formation of
4-hydroxy-amphetamine. Since CYP2D6 is genetically polymorphic,
population variations in amphetamine metabolism are a possibility.</p>
<p>Amphetamine is known to inhibit monoamine oxidase, whereas the ability of amphetamine and its metabolites to inhibit various P450 isozymes and other 
enzymes has not been adequately elucidated. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span>
experiments with human microsomes indicate minor inhibition of CYP2D6
by amphetamine and minor inhibition of CYP1A2, 2D6, and 3A4 by one or
more metabolites. However, due to the probability of auto-inhibition
and the lack of information on the concentration of these metabolites
relative to <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> concentrations, no predications regarding the 
potential for amphetamine or its metabolites to inhibit the metabolism of other drugs by CYP isozymes <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> can be made.</p>
<p>With normal urine pHs approximately half of an administered dose of amphetamine is
recoverable in urine as derivatives of alpha-hydroxy-amphetamine and
approximately another 30% to 40% of the dose is recoverable in urine as
amphetamine itself. Since amphetamine has a pKa of 9.9, urinary
recovery of amphetamine is highly dependent on pH and urine flow rates.
Alkaline urine pHs result in less ionization and reduced renal
elimination, and acidic pHs and high flow rates result in increased
renal elimination with clearances greater than glomerular filtration
rates, indicating the involvement of active secretion. Urinary recovery
of amphetamine has been reported to range from 1% to 75%, depending on
urinary pH, with the remaining fraction of the dose hepatically
metabolized. Consequently, both hepatic and renal dysfunction have the
potential to inhibit the elimination of amphetamine and result in
prolonged exposures. In addition, drugs that effect urinary pH are
known to alter the elimination of amphetamine, and any decrease in
amphetamine's metabolism that might occur due to drug interactions or
genetic polymorphisms is more likely to be clinically significant when
renal elimination is decreased, (<span class="Italics">see

implies the presence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4137162" conceptname="Overactive">hyperactive</span>-impulsive or inattentive symptoms
that caused impairment and were present before age 7 years. The
symptoms must cause clinically significant impairment, e.g., in social,
academic, or occupational functioning, and be present in two or more
settings, e.g., school (or work) and at home. The symptoms must not be
better accounted for by another <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432586" conceptname="Mental disorder">mental disorder</span>. For the Inattentive
Type, at least six of the following symptoms must have persisted for at
least 6 months: lack of attention to details/careless mistakes; lack of
sustained attention; poor listener; failure to follow through on tasks;
poor organization; avoids tasks requiring sustained mental effort;
loses things; easily distracted; forgetful. For the
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4137162" conceptname="Overactive">Hyperactive</span>-Impulsive Type, at least six of the following symptoms must
have persisted for at least 6 months: fidgeting/squirming; leaving
seat; inappropriate running/climbing; difficulty with quiet activities;
â€œon the go;â€? excessive talking; blurting answers; can't wait turn;
intrusive. The Combined Type requires both inattentive and
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4137162" conceptname="Overactive">hyperactive</span>-impulsive criteria to be met.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Special Diagnostic Considerations-</span> Specific etiology of this syndrome is unknown, and there is no single
diagnostic test. Adequate diagnosis requires the use not only of
medical but of special psychological, educational, and social
resources. Learning may or may not be impaired. The diagnosis must be
based upon a complete history and evaluation of the child and not
solely on the presence of the required number of DSM-IV<span class="Sup">Â®</span> characterostocs/</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Need for Comprehensive Treatment Program-</span> Tablets of Mixed Salts of a Single Entity Amphetamine Product are
indicated as an integral part of a total treatment program for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4228617" conceptname="Add">ADHD</span>
that may include other measures (psychological, educational, social)
for patients with this syndrome. Drug treatment may not be indicated
for all children with this syndrome. Stimulants are not intended for
use in the child who exhibits symptoms secondary to environmental
factors and/or other primary psychiatric disorders, including
<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436073" conceptname="Psychotic disorder">psychosis</span>. Appropriate educational placement is essential and
psychosocial intervention is often helpful. When remedial measures
alone are insufficient, the decision to prescribe stimulant medication
will depend upon the physician's assessment of the chronicity and
severity of the child's symptoms.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Long-Term Use-</span> The effectiveness of  Tablets of Mixed Salts of a Single Entity Amphetamine Product for long-term use  has not been systematically evaluated in controlled trials. Therefore, the  physician who elects to use Tablets of Mixed Salts of a Single Entity  Amphetamine Product for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the  long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.<br></p>

<p>Long-term Suppression of Growth</p>
<p>Careful follow-up of weight and height in children ages 7 to 10 
years who were randomized to either methylphenidate or non-medication treatment 
groups over 14 months, as well as in naturalistic subgroups of newly 
methylphenidate-treated and non-medication treated children over 36 months (to 
the ages of 10 to 13 years), suggests that consistently medicated children 
(i.e., treatment for 7 days per week throughout the year) have a temporary 
slowing in growth rate (on average, a total of about 2 cm less growth in height 
and 2.7 kg less growth in weight over 3 years), without evidence of growth 
rebound during this period of development. Published data are inadequate to 
determine whether chronic use of amphetamines may cause a similar suppression of 
growth, however, it is anticipated that they will likely have this effect as 
well. Therefore, growth should be monitored during treatment with stimulants, 
and patients who are not growing or gaining weight as expected may need to have 
their treatment interrupted.</p>

<p><span class="Bold">Acidifying agents</span> - Gastrointestinal acidifying agents (guadethidine, reserpine, glutamic acid HCI, ascorbic acid fruit juices, etc.) lower absorption of amphetamines.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Urinary acidifying agents</span> - (ammonium chloride, sodium acid phosphate, etc.)Â  Increase the concentration of the ionized species of the amphetamine molecule, thereby increasing urinary excretion.Â  Both groups of agents lower blood levels and efficacy of amphetamines.<br></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Adrenergic blocker</span> - Adrenergic blockers are inhibited by amphetamines.<br></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Alkalinizing agents</span> - Gastrointestinal alkalinizing agents (sodium <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4285456" conceptname="Bicarbonate">bicarbonate</span>, etc.) increase absorption of amphetamines.Â  Co-administration of Tablets of Mixed Salts of a Single Entity Amphetamine Product and gastrointestinal alkalizing agents, such as antacids, should be avoided.Â  Urinary alkalinizing agents (acetazolamide, some thiazides) increase the concentration of the non-ionized species of the amphetamine molecule, thereby decreasing urinary excretion.Â  Both groups of agents increase blood levels and therefore potentiate the actions of amphetamines.<br></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Antidepressants, tricyclic</span> - Amphetamines may enhance the activity of tricyclic or sympathomimetic agents; d-amphetamine with desipramine or protriptyline and possibly other tricyclics cause striking and sustained increases in the concentration of d-amphetamine in the brain; cardiovascular effects can be potentiated.<br></p>
<p><span class="Bold">MAO inhibitors</span> - MAOI antidepressants, as well as a metabolite of furazolidone, slow amphetamine metabolism.Â  This slowing potentiates amphetamines, increasing their effect on the release of norepinephrine and other monoamines from adrenergic nerve endings; this can cause <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="378253" conceptname="Headache">headaches</span> and other signs of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="312938" conceptname="Hypertensive encephalopathy">hypertensive crisis</span>.Â  A variety of neurological toxic effects and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440285" conceptname="Malignant hyperthermia">malignant hyperpyrexia</span> can occur, sometimes with fatal results.<br></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Antihistamines</span> - Amphetamines may counteract the sedative effect of antihistamines.<br></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Antihypertensives</span> - Amphetamines may antagonize the hypotensive effects of antihypertensives.<br></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Chlorpromazine</span> - Chlorpromazine blocks dopamine and norepinephrine receptors, thus inhibiting the central stimulants effects of amphetamines, and can be used to treat amphetamine <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442562" conceptname="Poisoning">poisoning</span>.<br></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Ethosuximide</span> - Amphetamines may delay intestinal absorption of ethosuximide.<br></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Haloperidol</span> - Haloperidol blocks dopamine receptors, thus inhibiting the central stimulant effects of amphetamines.<br></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Lithium carbonate</span> - The <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442165" conceptname="Loss of appetite">anorectic</span> and stimulatory effects of amphetamines may be inhibited by lithium carbonate.<br></p>

<p><span class="Bold">Methenamine therapy</span> - Urinary excretion of amphetamines is increased, and efficacy is reduced, by acidifying agents used in methenamine therapy.<br></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Norepinephrine</span> - Amphetamines enhance the adrenergic effect of norepinephrine.<br></p>
<p><span class="Bold">Phenytoin</span> - Amphetaimes may delay intestinal absorption of phenytoin; co-administration of phenytoin may produce a synergistic anticonvulsant action.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Propoxyphene</span> - In cases of propoxyphene overdosage, amphetamine CNS stimulation is potentiated and fatal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="377091" conceptname="Seizure">convulsions</span> can occur.</p>
