<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">A variety of clinical studies have demonstrated that elevated levels of total <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> (total-C), low density lipoprotein <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> (LDL-C), and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4122128" conceptname="Apolipoprotein">apolipoprotein</span> B (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4098284" conceptname="Apolipoprotein B">apo B</span>), an LDL membrane complex, are associated with human <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4103842" conceptname="Arteriosclerosis">atherosclerosis</span>.  Similarly, decreased levels of high density lipoprotein <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> (HDL-C) and its transport complex, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4122128" conceptname="Apolipoprotein">apolipoprotein</span> A (apo AI and apo AII) are associated with the development of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4103842" conceptname="Arteriosclerosis">atherosclerosis</span>.  Epidemiologic investigations have established that cardiovascular morbidity and mortality vary directly with the level of total-C, LDL-C, and triglycerides, and inversely with the level of HDL-C.  The independent effect of raising HDL-C or lowering triglycerides (TG) on the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined.</p>
<p>Fenofibric acid, the active metabolite of fenofibrate, produces reductions in total <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span>, LDL <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4122128" conceptname="Apolipoprotein">apolipoprotein</span> B, total triglycerides and triglyceride rich lipoprotein (VLDL) in treated patients.  In addition, treatment with fenofibrate results in increases in high density lipoprotein (HDL) and apoproteins apoAI and apoAII.</p>
<p>The effects of fenofibric acid seen in clinical practice have been explained <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> in transgenic mice and <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> in human hepatocyte cultures by the activation of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor α (PPARα).  Through this mechanism, fenofibrate increases lipolysis and elimination of triglyceride-rich particles from plasma by activating lipoprotein lipase and reducing production of apoprotein C-III (an inhibitor of lipoprotein lipase activity).</p>
<p>The resulting <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">fall</span> in triglycerides produces an alteration in the size and composition of LDL from small, dense particles (which are thought to be atherogenic due to their susceptibility to oxidation), to large buoyant particles.  These larger particles have a greater affinity for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span> receptors and are catabolized rapidly.  Activation of PPARα also induces an increase in the synthesis of apoproteins A-I, A-II and HDL-<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4224820" conceptname="Cholesterol">cholesterol</span>.</p>
<p>Fenofibrate also reduces serum uric acid levels in hyperuricemic and normal individuals by increasing the urinary excretion of uric acid.</p>

<a name="section-2.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>Pharmacokinetics/Metabolism</h2>
<p class="First">Plasma concentrations of fenofibric acid after administration of three 48 mg or one 145 mg tablets are equivalent under fed conditions to one 200 mg capsule.</p>
<div class="Section">
<a name="section-2.1.1"></a><p></p>
<h3>Absorption</h3>
<p class="First">The absolute bioavailability of fenofibrate cannot be determined as the compound is virtually insoluble in aqueous media suitable for injection.  However, fenofibrate is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.  Following oral administration in healthy volunteers, approximately 60% of a single dose of radiolabelled fenofibrate appeared in urine, primarily as fenofibric acid and its glucuronate conjugate, and 25% was excreted in the feces.  Peak plasma levels of fenofibric acid occur within 6 to 8 hours after administration.</p>
<p>Exposure to fenofibric acid in plasma, as measured by C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC, is not significantly different when a single 145 mg dose of fenofibrate is administered under fasting or nonfasting conditions.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section">
<a name="section-2.1.2"></a><p></p>
<h3>Distribution</h3>
<p class="First">Upon multiple dosing of fenofibrate, fenofibric acid steady state is achieved within 9 days.  Plasma concentrations of fenofibric acid at steady state are approximately double those following a single dose. Serum protein binding was approximately 99% in normal and hyperlipidemic subjects. </p>
</div>
<div class="Section">
<a name="section-2.1.3"></a><p></p>
<h3>Metabolism</h3>
<p class="First">Following oral administration, fenofibrate is rapidly hydrolyzed by esterases to the active metabolite, fenofibric acid; no unchanged fenofibrate is detected in plasma.</p>
<p>Fenofibric acid is primarily conjugated with glucuronic acid and then excreted in urine.  A small amount of fenofibric acid is reduced at the carbonyl moiety to a benzhydrol metabolite which is, in turn, conjugated with glucuronic acid and excreted in urine.</p>
<p><span class="Italics">In vivo  </span>metabolism data indicate that neither fenofibrate nor fenofibric acid undergo oxidative metabolism (e.g., cytochrome P450) to a significant extent.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section">
<a name="section-2.1.4"></a><p></p>
<h3>Excretion</h3>
<p class="First">After absorption, fenofibrate is mainly excreted in the urine in the form of metabolites, primarily fenofibric acid and fenofibric acid glucuronide.  After administration of radiolabelled fenofibrate, approximately 60% of the dose appeared in the urine and 25% was excreted in the feces.</p>
<p>Fenofibric acid is eliminated with a half-life of 20 hours, allowing once daily administration in a clinical setting.</p>

<h2>Special Populations</h2>
<p class="First"></p>
<div class="Section">
<a name="section-2.2.1"></a><p></p>
<h3>Geriatrics</h3>
<p class="First">In elderly volunteers 77 - 87 years of age, the oral clearance of fenofibric acid following a single oral dose of fenofibrate was 1.2 L/h, which compares to 1.1 L/h in young adults.  This indicates that a similar dosage regimen can be used in the elderly, without increasing accumulation of the drug or metabolites.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section">
<a name="section-2.2.2"></a><p></p>
<h3>Pediatrics</h3>
<p class="First">TRICOR has not been investigated in adequate and well-controlled trials in pediatric patients.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section">
<a name="section-2.2.3"></a><p></p>
<h3>Gender</h3>
<p class="First">No pharmacokinetic difference between males and females has been observed for fenofibrate.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section">
<a name="section-2.2.4"></a><p></p>
<h3>Race</h3>
<p class="First">The influence of race on the pharmacokinetics of fenofibrate has not been studied, however fenofibrate is not metabolized by enzymes known for exhibiting inter-ethnic variability.  Therefore, inter-ethnic pharmacokinetic differences are very unlikely.</p>

<h3><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">Renal Insufficiency</span></h3>
<p class="First">The pharmacokinetics of fenofibric acid was examined in patients with mild, moderate, and severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span>. Patients with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> (creatinine clearance [CrCl] ≤ 30 mL/min) showed 2.7-fold increase in exposure for fenofibric acid and increased accumulation of fenofibric acid during chronic dosing compared to that of healthy subjects. Patients with mild to moderate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> (CrCl 30-80 mL/min) had similar exposure but an increase in the half-life for fenofibric acid compared to that of healthy subjects. Based on these findings, the use of TRICOR should be avoided in patients who have severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span> and dose reduction is required in patients having mild to moderate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span>.</p>

<a name="section-2.2.7"></a><p></p>
<h3>Drug-drug Interactions</h3>
<p class="First"><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies using human liver microsomes indicate that fenofibrate and fenofibric acid are not inhibitors of cytochrome (CYP) P450 isoforms CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, or CYP1A2.  They are weak inhibitors of CYP2C8, CYP2C19 and CYP2A6, and mild-to-moderate inhibitors of CYP2C9 at therapeutic concentrations.</p>
<p>Potentiation of coumarin-type anticoagulants has been observed with prolongation of the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4173906" conceptname="Clotting factor II assay">prothrombin</span> time/INR.</p>
<p>Bile acid sequestrants have been shown to bind other drugs given concurrently.  Therefore, fenofibrate should be taken at least 1 hour before or 4-6 hours after a bile acid binding resin to avoid impeding its absorption. (See <span class="Bold">WARNINGS  </span> and <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>).</p>
<p>Concomitant administration of fenofibrate (equivalent to TRICOR 145 mg) with pravastatin (40 mg) once daily for 10 days has been shown to increase the mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC values for pravastatin by 36% (range from 69% decrease to 321% increase) and 28% (range from 54% decrease to 128% increase), respectively, and for 3α-hydroxy-iso-pravastatin by 55% (range from 32% decrease to 314% increase) and 39% (range from 24% decrease to 261% increase), respectively in 23 healthy adults.</p>
<p>Concomitant administration of a single dose of fenofibrate (equivalent to 145 mg TRICOR) and a single dose of fluvastatin (40 mg) resulted in a small increase (approximately 15-16%) in exposure to (+)3R,5S-fluvastatin, the active enantiomer of fluvastatin.	</p>
<p>A single dose of either pravastatin or fluvastatin had no clinically important effect on the pharmacokinetics of fenofibric acid.</p>
<p>Concomitant administration of fenofibrate (equivalent to TRICOR 145 mg) with atorvastatin (20 mg) once daily for 10 days resulted in approximately 17% decrease (range from 67% decrease to 44% increase) in atorvastatin AUC values in 22 healthy males.  The atorvastatin C<span class="Sub">max</span> values were not significantly affected by fenofibrate.  The pharmacokinetics of fenofibric acid were not significantly affected by atorvastatin.</p>
<p>Concomitant administration of fenofibrate (equivalent to TRICOR 145 mg) once daily for 10 days with glimepiride (1 mg tablet) single dose simultaneously with the last dose of fenofibrate resulted in a 35% increase in mean AUC of glimepiride in healthy subjects.  Glimepiride C<span class="Sub">max</span> was not significantly affected by fenofibrate co-administration. There was no statistically significant effect of multiple doses of fenofibrate on glucose nadir or AUC with the baseline glucose concentration as the covariate after glimepiride administration in healthy volunteers. However, glucose concentrations at 24 hours remained statistically significantly lower after pretreatment with fenofibrate than with glimepiride alone.  Glimepiride had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of fenofibric acid.</p>
<p>Concomitant administration of fenofibrate (54 mg) and metformin (850 mg) three times a day for 10 days resulted in no significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of fenofibric acid and metformin when compared with the two drugs administered alone in healthy subjects. </p>
<p>Concomitant administration of fenofibrate (equivalent to TRICOR 145 mg) once daily for 14 days with rosiglitazone tablet (rosiglitazone maleate) (8 mg) once daily for 5 days, Day 10 through Day 14, resulted in no significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of fenofibric acid and rosiglitazone when compared with the two drugs administered alone in healthy subjects.</p>
<p>Concomitant administration of fenofibrate (145 mg TRICOR) with ezetimibe (10 mg) once daily for 10 days to 18 healthy adults resulted in increases in total ezetimibe AUC, C<span class="Sub">max</span> and C<span class="Sub">min</span> of approximately 43%, 33% and 56%, respectively, and increases in ezetimibe glucuronide AUC, C<span class="Sub">max</span> and C<span class="Sub">min</span> of approximately 49%, 34% and 62%, respectively.  The pharmacokinetics of fenofibric acid were not significantly affected by ezetimibe and the multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of free (unconjugated) ezetimibe were not significantly affected by fenofibrate.</p>

<h2>Treatment of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440360" conceptname="Pure hyperglyceridemia">Hypertriglyceridemia</span></h2>
<p class="First">TRICOR is also indicated as adjunctive therapy to diet for treatment of adult patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440360" conceptname="Pure hyperglyceridemia">hypertriglyceridemia</span> (Fredrickson Types IV and V <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432867" conceptname="Hyperlipidemia">hyperlipidemia</span>).  Improving glycemic control in diabetic patients showing fasting chylomicronemia will usually reduce fasting triglycerides and eliminate chylomicronemia thereby obviating the need for pharmacologic intervention.</p>
<p>Markedly elevated levels of serum triglycerides (e.g. &gt; 2,000 mg/dL) may increase the risk of developing <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4192640" conceptname="Pancreatitis">pancreatitis</span>.  The effect of TRICOR therapy on reducing this risk has not been adequately studied.</p>
<p>Drug therapy is not indicated for patients with Type I <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432867" conceptname="Hyperlipidemia">hyperlipoproteinemia</span>, who have elevations of chylomicrons and plasma triglycerides, but who have normal levels of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL).  Inspection of plasma refrigerated for 14 hours is helpful in distinguishing Types I, IV and V <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432867" conceptname="Hyperlipidemia">hyperlipoproteinemia</span><span class="Sup">2</span>.</p>
<p>The initial treatment for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4159131" conceptname="Dyslipidemia">dyslipidemia</span> is dietary therapy specific for the type of lipoprotein abnormality.  Excess body weight and excess alcoholic intake may be important factors in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440360" conceptname="Pure hyperglyceridemia">hypertriglyceridemia</span> and should be addressed prior to any drug therapy.  Physical exercise can be an important ancillary measure.  Diseases contributory to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432867" conceptname="Hyperlipidemia">hyperlipidemia</span>, such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140673" conceptname="Hypothyroidism">hypothyroidism</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> mellitus should be looked for and adequately treated.  Estrogen therapy, thiazide diuretics and beta-blockers, are sometimes associated with massive rises in plasma triglycerides, especially in subjects with familial <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440360" conceptname="Pure hyperglyceridemia">hypertriglyceridemia</span>.  In such cases, discontinuation of the specific etiologic agent may obviate the need for specific drug therapy of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440360" conceptname="Pure hyperglyceridemia">hypertriglyceridemia</span>.</p>
<p>The use of drugs should be considered only when reasonable attempts have been made to obtain satisfactory results with non-drug methods.  If the decision is made to use drugs, the patient should be instructed that this does not reduce the importance of adhering to diet.

<h1>WARNINGS</h1>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-5.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>Liver Function</h2>
<p class="First">Fenofibrate at doses equivalent to 96 mg to 145 mg TRICOR per day has been associated with increases in serum transaminases [AST (<span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4094657" conceptname="Aspartate aminotransferase">SGOT</span>) or ALT (SGPT)].  In a pooled analysis of 10 placebo-controlled trials, increases to &gt; 3 times the upper limit of normal occurred in 5.3% of patients taking fenofibrate versus 1.1% of patients treated with placebo.</p>
<p>When transaminase determinations were followed either after discontinuation of treatment or during continued treatment, a return to normal limits was usually observed.  The incidence of increases in transaminases related to fenofibrate therapy appear to be dose related.  In an 8-week dose-ranging study, the incidence of ALT or AST elevations to at least three times the upper limit of normal was 13% in patients receiving dosages equivalent to 96 mg to 145 mg TRICOR per day and was 0% in those receiving dosages equivalent to 48 mg or less TRICOR per day, or placebo.  Hepatocellular, chronic active and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4318541" conceptname="Cholestatic hepatitis">cholestatic hepatitis</span> associated with fenofibrate therapy have been reported after exposures of weeks to several years.  In extremely rare cases, cirrhosis has been reported in association with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4026125" conceptname="Chronic active hepatitis">chronic active hepatitis</span>.</p>
<p>Regular periodic monitoring of liver function, including serum ALT (SGPT) should be performed for the duration of therapy with TRICOR, and therapy discontinued if enzyme levels persist above three times the normal limit.</p>

<h2>Concomitant Oral Anticoagulants</h2>
<p class="First">Caution should be exercised when anticoagulants are given in conjunction with TRICOR because of the potentiation of coumarin-type anticoagulants in prolonging the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4173906" conceptname="Clotting factor II assay">prothrombin</span> time/INR.  The dosage of the anticoagulant should be reduced to maintain the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4173906" conceptname="Clotting factor II assay">prothrombin</span> time/INR at the desired level to prevent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">bleeding</span> complications.  Frequent <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4173906" conceptname="Clotting factor II assay">prothrombin</span> time/INR determinations are advisable until it has been definitely determined that the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4173906" conceptname="Clotting factor II assay">prothrombin</span> time/INR has stabilized.</p>

<h2>Concomitant HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors</h2>
<p class="First">The combined use of TRICOR and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors should be avoided unless the benefit of further alterations in lipid levels is likely to outweigh the increased risk of this drug combination.</p>
<p>Concomitant administration of fenofibrate (equivalent to TRICOR 145 mg) and pravastatin (40 mg) once daily for 10 days increased the mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC values for pravastatin by 36% (range from 69% decrease to 321% increase) and 28% (range from 54% decrease to 128% increase), respectively, and for 3α-hydroxy-iso-pravastatin by 55% (range from 32% decrease to 314% increase) and 39% (range from 24% decrease to 261% increase), respectively.  (See also <span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Drug-drug Interactions</span>).</p>
<p>The combined use of fibric acid derivatives and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors has been associated, in the absence of a marked <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4196500" conceptname="Drug interaction">pharmacokinetic interaction</span>, in numerous case reports, with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4230337" conceptname="Rhabdomyolysis">rhabdomyolysis</span>, markedly elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="439142" conceptname="Myoglobinuria">myoglobinuria</span>, leading in a high proportion of cases to <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="197320" conceptname="Acute renal failure syndrome">acute renal failure</span>.</p>

<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">

<h2>Other Considerations</h2>
<p class="First">The Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">Diabetes</span> (FIELD) study was a 5-year randomized, placebo-controlled study of 9795 patients with type 2 <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> mellitus treated with fenofibrate. Fenofibrate demonstrated a non-significant 11% relative reduction in the primary outcome of coronary heart disease events (hazard ratio [HR] 0.89, 95% CI 0.75-1.05, p=0.16) and a significant 11% reduction in the secondary outcome of total cardiovascular disease events (HR 0.89 [0.80-0.99], p=0.04). There was a non-significant 11% (HR 1.11 [0.95, 1.29], p=0.18) and 19% (HR 1.19 [0.90, 1.57], p=0.22) increase in total and coronary heart disease mortality, respectively, with fenofibrate as compared to placebo.</p>
<p>In the Coronary Drug Project, a large study of post <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4329847" conceptname="Myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</span> of patients treated for 5 years with clofibrate, there was no difference in mortality seen between the clofibrate group and the placebo group.  There was however, a difference in the rate of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4098112" conceptname="Biliary sludge">cholelithiasis</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192956" conceptname="Cholecystitis">cholecystitis</span> requiring surgery between the two groups (3.0% vs. 1.8%).</p>
<p>Because of chemical, pharmacological, and clinical similarities between TRICOR (fenofibrate tablets), Atromid-S (clofibrate), and Lopid (gemfibrozil), the adverse findings in 4 large randomized, placebo-controlled clinical studies with these other fibrate drugs may also apply to TRICOR.</p>
<p>In a study conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO), 5000 subjects without known <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317576" conceptname="Coronary arteriosclerosis">coronary artery disease</span> were treated with placebo or clofibrate for 5 years and followed for an additional one year.  There was a statistically significant, higher age − adjusted all-cause mortality in the clofibrate group compared with the placebo group (5.70% vs. 3.96%, p = &lt; 0.01).  Excess mortality was due to a 33% increase in non-cardiovascular causes, including malignancy, post-cholecystectomy complications, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4192640" conceptname="Pancreatitis">pancreatitis</span>.  This appeared to confirm the higher risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192353" conceptname="Disorder of gallbladder">gallbladder disease</span> seen in clofibrate-treated patients studied in the Coronary Drug Project.</p>
<p>The Helsinki Heart Study was a large (n=4081) study of middle-aged men without a history of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="317576" conceptname="Coronary arteriosclerosis">coronary artery disease</span>.  Subjects received either placebo or gemfibrozil for 5 years, with a 3.5 year open extension afterward.  Total mortality was numerically higher in the gemfibrozil randomization group but did not achieve statistical significance (p = 0.19, 95% confidence interval for relative risk G:P = .91-1.64).  Although cancer <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> trended higher in the gemfibrozil group (p = 0.11), cancers (excluding basal cell carcinoma) were diagnosed with equal frequency in both study groups.  Due to the limited size of the study, the relative risk of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">death</span> from any cause was not shown to be different than that seen in the 9 year follow-up data from World Health Organization study (RR=1.29).  Similarly, the numerical excess of gallbladder surgeries in the gemfibrozil group did not differ statistically from that observed in the WHO study.</p>
<p>A secondary prevention component of the Helsinki Heart Study enrolled middle-aged men excluded from the primary prevention study because of known or suspected coronary heart disease.  Subjects received gemfibrozil or placebo for 5 years.  Although cardiac <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4306655" conceptname="Death">deaths</span> trended higher in the gemfibrozil group, this was not statistically significant (hazard ratio 2.2, 95% confidence interval:  0.94-5.05).  The rate of gallbladder surgery was not statistically significant between study groups, but did trend higher in the gemfibrozil group, (1.9% vs. 0.3%, p = 0.07).  There was a statistically significant difference in the number of appendectomies in the gemfibrozil group (6/311 vs. 0/317, p = 0.029).</p>

<h1>PRECAUTIONS</h1>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-6.1"></a><p></p>
<h2>Initial Therapy</h2>
<p class="First">Laboratory studies should be done to ascertain that the lipid levels are consistently abnormal before instituting TRICOR therapy.  Every attempt should be made to control serum lipids with appropriate diet, exercise, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4134010" conceptname="Weight decreased">weight loss</span> in obese patients, and control of any medical problems such as <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201820" conceptname="Diabetes mellitus">diabetes</span> mellitus and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140673" conceptname="Hypothyroidism">hypothyroidism</span> that are contributing to the lipid abnormalities.  Medications known to exacerbate <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440360" conceptname="Pure hyperglyceridemia">hypertriglyceridemia</span> (beta blockers, thiazides, estrogens) should be discontinued or changed if possible prior to consideration of triglyceride-lowering drug therapy.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-6.2"></a><p></p>
<h2>Continued Therapy</h2>
<p class="First">Periodic determination of serum lipids should be obtained during initial therapy in order to establish the lowest effective dose of TRICOR.  Therapy should be withdrawn in patients who do not have an adequate response after two months of treatment with the maximum recommended dose of 145 mg per day.</p>

<h2><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4192640" conceptname="Pancreatitis">Pancreatitis</span></h2>
<p class="First"><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4192640" conceptname="Pancreatitis">Pancreatitis</span> has been reported in patients taking fenofibrate, gemfibrozil, and clofibrate.  This occurrence may represent a failure of efficacy in patients with severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440360" conceptname="Pure hyperglyceridemia">hypertriglyceridemia</span>, a direct drug effect, or a secondary phenomenon mediated through biliary tract stone or sludge formation with obstruction of the common bile duct.</p>

<h2><span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">Hypersensitivity Reactions</span></h2>
<p class="First">Acute <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4084167" conceptname="Acute allergic reaction">hypersensitivity reactions</span> including severe <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">skin rashes</span> requiring patient hospitalization and treatment with steroids have occurred very rarely during treatment with fenofibrate, including rare spontaneous reports of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="141651" conceptname="Stevens-Johnson syndrome">Stevens-Johnson syndrome</span>, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="443754" conceptname="Lyell's toxic epidermal necrolysis, subepidermal type">toxic epidermal necrolysis</span>.  <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="139900" conceptname="Urticaria">Urticaria</span> was seen in 1.1 vs. 0%, and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="140214" conceptname="Eruption">rash</span> in 1.4 vs. 0.8% of fenofibrate and placebo patients respectively in controlled trials.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-6.5"></a><p></p>
<h2>Hematologic Changes</h2>
<p class="First">Mild to moderate hemoglobin, hematocrit, and white blood cell decreases have been observed in patients following initiation of fenofibrate therapy.  However, these levels stabilize during long-term administration.  Extremely rare spontaneous reports of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432870" conceptname="Thrombocytopenic disorder">thrombocytopenia</span> and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440689" conceptname="Agranulocytosis">agranulocytosis</span> have been received during post-marketing surveillance outside of the U.S.  Periodic blood counts are recommended during the first 12 months of TRICOR administration.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-6.6"></a><p></p>
<h2>Skeletal Muscle</h2>
<p class="First">The use of fibrates alone, including TRICOR, may occasionally be associated with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137275" conceptname="Disorder of muscle">myopathy</span>.  Treatment with drugs of the fibrate class has been associated on rare occasions with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4230337" conceptname="Rhabdomyolysis">rhabdomyolysis</span>, usually in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span>.  <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137275" conceptname="Disorder of muscle">Myopathy</span> should be considered in any patient with diffuse <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="442752" conceptname="Muscle pain">myalgias</span>, muscle <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4082445" conceptname="Tenderness">tenderness</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437113" conceptname="Asthenia">weakness</span>, and/or marked elevations of creatine phosphokinase levels.</p>

CPK levels should be assessed in patients reporting these symptoms, and fenofibrate therapy should be discontinued if markedly elevated CPK levels occur or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="137275" conceptname="Disorder of muscle">myopathy</span> is diagnosed.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-6.7"></a><p></p>
<h2>Venothromboembolic Disease </h2>
<p class="First">In the FIELD trial, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440417" conceptname="Pulmonary embolism">pulmonary embolus</span> (PE) and <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4042396" conceptname="Deep thrombophlebitis">deep vein thrombosis</span> (DVT) were observed at higher rates in the fenofibrate- than the placebo-treated group. Of 9,795 patients enrolled in FIELD, there were 4,900 in the placebo group and 4,895 in the fenofibrate group. For DVT, there were 48 events (1%) in the placebo group and 67 (1%) in the fenofibrate group (p = 0.074); and for PE, there were 32 (0.7%) events in the placebo group and 53 (1%) in the fenofibrate group (p = 0.022). </p>
<p>In the Coronary Drug Project, a higher proportion of the clofibrate group experienced definite or suspected fatal or nonfatal <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440417" conceptname="Pulmonary embolism">pulmonary embolism</span> or <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="320741" conceptname="Thrombophlebitis">thrombophlebitis</span> than the placebo group (5.2% vs. 3.3% at five years; p &lt; 0.01).</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-6.8"></a><p></p>
<h2>Serum Creatinine</h2>
<p class="First">Elevations in serum creatinine have been reported in patients on fenofibrate.  These elevations tend to return to baseline following discontinuation of fenofibrate.  The clinical significance of these observations is unknown.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34073-7">
<a name="section-6.9"></a><p></p>
<h2>Drug Interactions</h2>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-6.9.1"></a><p></p>
<h3>Oral Anticoagulants</h3>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">CAUTION SHOULD BE EXERCISED WHEN COUMARIN ANTICOAGULANTS ARE GIVEN IN CONJUNCTION WITH TRICOR.  THE DOSAGE OF THE ANTICOAGULANTS SHOULD BE REDUCED TO MAINTAIN THE <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4173906" conceptname="Clotting factor II assay">PROTHROMBIN</span> TIME/INR AT THE DESIRED LEVEL TO PREVENT <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437312" conceptname="Bleeding">BLEEDING</span> COMPLICATIONS.  FREQUENT <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4173906" conceptname="Clotting factor II assay">PROTHROMBIN</span> TIME/INR DETERMINATIONS ARE ADVISABLE UNTIL IT HAS BEEN DEFINITELY DETERMINED THAT THE <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4173906" conceptname="Clotting factor II assay">PROTHROMBIN</span> TIME/INR HAS STABILIZED.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-6.9.2"></a><p></p>
<h3>HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors</h3>
<p class="First">The combined use of TRICOR and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors should be avoided unless the benefit of further alterations in lipid levels is likely to outweigh the increased risk of this drug combination (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>).</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-6.9.3"></a><p></p>
<h3>Resins</h3>
<p class="First">Since bile acid sequestrants may bind other drugs given concurrently, patients should take TRICOR at least 1 hour before or 4-6 hours after a bile acid binding resin to avoid impeding its absorption.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5">
<a name="section-6.9.4"></a><p></p>
<h3>Cyclosporine</h3>
<p class="First">Because cyclosporine can produce <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4126119" conceptname="Toxic nephropathy">nephrotoxicity</span> with decreases in creatinine clearance and rises in serum creatinine, and because renal excretion is the primary elimination route of fibrate drugs including TRICOR, there is a risk that an interaction will lead to deterioration.  The benefits and risks of using TRICOR (fenofibrate tablets) with immunosuppressants and other potentially nephrotoxic agents should be carefully considered, and the lowest effective dose employed.</p>

<h2>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h2>
<p class="First">Two dietary carcinogenicity studies have been conducted in rats with fenofibrate.  In the first 24-month study, rats were dosed with fenofibrate at 10, 45, and 200 mg/kg/day, approximately 0.3, 1, and 6 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD), based on body surface area comparisons (mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>). At a dose of 200 mg/kg/day (at 6 times the MRHD), the incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201519" conceptname="Primary malignant neoplasm of liver">liver carcinomas</span> was significantly increased in both sexes.  A statistically significant increase in pancreatic carcinomas was observed in males at 1 and 6 times the MRHD; an increase in <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4243445" conceptname="Benign neoplasm of pancreas">pancreatic adenomas</span> and benign testicular interstitial cell tumors was observed at 6 times the MRHD in males.  In a second 24-month rat carcinogenicity study in a different <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4168796" conceptname="Muscle strain">strain</span> of rats, doses of 10 and 60 mg/kg/day (0.3 and 2 times the MRHD) produced significant increases in the incidence of pancreatic acinar <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106411" conceptname="Adenofibroma">adenomas</span> in both sexes and increases in testicular interstitial cell tumors in males at 2 times the MRHD.</p>
<p>A 117-week carcinogenicity study was conducted in rats comparing three drugs:  fenofibrate 10 and 60 mg/kg/day (0.3 and 2 times the MRHD), clofibrate (400 mg/kg/day; 2 times the human dose), and gemfibrozil (250 mg/kg/day; 2 times the human dose, based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> surface area). Fenofibrate increased pancreatic acinar <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106411" conceptname="Adenofibroma">adenomas</span> in both sexes.  Clofibrate increased hepatocellular carcinoma and pancreatic acinar <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106411" conceptname="Adenofibroma">adenomas</span> in males and hepatic neoplastic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4101098" conceptname="Nodule">nodules</span> in females.  Gemfibrozil increased hepatic neoplastic <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4101098" conceptname="Nodule">nodules</span> in males and females, while all three drugs increased testicular interstitial cell tumors in males.</p>
<p>In a 21-month study in mice, fenofibrate 10, 45, and 200 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.2, 1, and 3 times the MRHD on the basis of mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> surface area) significantly increased the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201519" conceptname="Primary malignant neoplasm of liver">liver carcinomas</span> in both sexes at 3 times the MRHD.  In a second 18-month study at 10, 60, and 200 mg/kg/day, fenofibrate significantly increased the <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="201519" conceptname="Primary malignant neoplasm of liver">liver carcinomas</span> in male mice and liver <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4106411" conceptname="Adenofibroma">adenomas</span> in female mice at 3 times the MRHD.</p>
<p>Electron microscopy studies have demonstrated peroxisomal proliferation following fenofibrate administration to the rat.  An adequate study to test for peroxisome proliferation in humans has not been done, but changes in peroxisome morphology and numbers have been observed in humans after treatment with other members of the fibrate class when liver biopsies were compared before and after treatment in the same individual.</p>
<p>Fenofibrate has been demonstrated to be devoid of mutagenic potential in the following tests:  Ames, mouse <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432571" conceptname="Malignant lymphoma">lymphoma</span>, chromosomal aberration and unscheduled DNA synthesis in primary rat hepatocytes.</p>
<p>In fertility studies rats were given oral dietary doses of fenofibrate, males received 61 days prior to mating and females 15 days prior to mating through weaning which resulted in no adverse effect on fertility at doses up to 300 mg/kg/day (~10 times the MRHD, based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> surface area comparisons).</p>

<h2>Pregnancy</h2>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42228-7">
<a name="section-6.11.1"></a><p></p>
<h3>Pregnancy Category C</h3>
<p class="First">Safety in pregnant women has not been established. There are no adequate and well controlled studies of fenofibrate in pregnant women. Fenofibrate should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p>
<p>In female rats given oral dietary doses of 15, 75, and 300 mg/kg/day of fenofibrate from 15 days prior to mating through weaning, maternal toxicity was observed at 0.3 times the MRHD, based on body surface area comparisons; mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>.</p>
<p>In pregnant rats given oral dietary doses of 14, 127, and 361 mg/kg/day from gestation day 6-15 during the period of organogenesis, adverse developmental findings were not observed at 14 mg/kg/day (less than 1 times the MRHD, based on body surface area comparisons; mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>). At higher multiples of human doses evidence of maternal toxicity was observed.</p>
<p>In pregnant rabbits given oral gavage doses of 15, 150, and 300 mg/kg/day from gestation day 6-18 during the period of organogenesis and allowed to deliver, aborted litters were observed at 150 mg/kg/day (10 times the MRHD, based on body surface area comparisons: mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>). No developmental findings were observed at 15 mg/kg/day (at less than 1 times the MRHD, based on body surface area comparisons; mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>).</p>
<p>In pregnant rats given oral dietary doses of 15, 75, and 300 mg/kg/day from gestation day 15 through lactation day 21 (weaning), maternal toxicity was observed at less than 1 times the MRHD, based on body surface area comparisons; mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>.</p>

<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34080-2">
<a name="section-6.12"></a><p></p>
<h2>Nursing Mothers</h2>
<p class="First">It is not known whether fenofibrate is excreted into milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from fenofibrate, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or administration of fenofibrate taking into account the importance of the drug to the lactating woman.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34081-0">

<h2>Pediatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">Safety and efficacy in pediatric patients have not been established.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34082-8">
<a name="section-6.14"></a><p></p>
<h2>Geriatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">Fenofibric acid is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span>. Fenofibric acid exposure is not influenced by age.  However, elderly patients have a higher incidence of <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">renal impairment</span>, such that dose selection for the elderly should be made on the basis of renal function (see <span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</span>, <span class="Bold">Special Populations</span>, <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="192359" conceptname="Renal failure syndrome">Renal Insufficiency</span>). Elderly patients with normal renal function should require no dose modifications.</p>

<h2></h2>
<p class="First">Adverse events reported by 2% or more of patients treated with fenofibrate during the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, regardless of causality, are listed in the table below.  Adverse events led to discontinuation of treatment in 5.0% of patients treated with fenofibrate and in 3.0% treated with placebo.  Increases in liver function tests were the most frequent events, causing discontinuation of fenofibrate treatment in 1.6% of patients in double-blind trials.</p>

<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<p class="First">There is no specific treatment for <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> with TRICOR.  General supportive care of the patient is indicated, including monitoring of vital signs and observation of clinical status, should an <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4208104" conceptname="Drug overdose">overdose</span> occur.  If indicated, elimination of unabsorbed drug should be achieved by <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="441408" conceptname="Vomiting">emesis</span> or gastric lavage; usual precautions should be observed to maintain the airway.  Because fenofibrate is highly bound to plasma proteins, hemodialysis should not be considered.</p>

<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">Patients should be placed on an appropriate lipid-lowering diet before receiving TRICOR, and should continue this diet during treatment with TRICOR.  TRICOR tablets can be given without regard to meals.</p>
<p>For the treatment of adult patients with primary <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="437827" conceptname="Pure hypercholesterolemia">hypercholesterolemia</span> or mixed <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="432867" conceptname="Hyperlipidemia">hyperlipidemia</span>, the initial dose of TRICOR is 145 mg per day.</p>
<p>For adult patients with <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="440360" conceptname="Pure hyperglyceridemia">hypertriglyceridemia</span>, the initial dose is 48 to 145 mg per day. Dosage should be individualized according to patient response, and should be adjusted if necessary following repeat lipid determinations at 4 to 8 week intervals.  The maximum dose is 145 mg per day.</p>
<p>Treatment with TRICOR should be initiated at a dose of 48 mg/day in patients having mild to moderately <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="4030518" conceptname="Renal impairment">impaired renal function</span>, and increased only after evaluation of the effects on renal function and  lipid levels at this dose.</p>
<p>Lipid levels should be monitored periodically and consideration should be given to reducing the dosage of TRICOR if lipid levels <span class="product-label-link" type="condition" conceptid="436583" conceptname="Fall">fall</span> significantly below the targeted range.</p>
